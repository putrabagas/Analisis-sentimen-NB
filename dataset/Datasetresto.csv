1,My gfs and I have an amazing time here! We had the mushroom raviolis for an appetizer (which were delicious and could be a meal) and steaks for dinner. The truffle butter steak was OUT OF THIS WORLD! Highly recommend!
1,It is the best food ever and the drinks too I would love to come her again with my friend next year. Thank you
1,"Came here with a friend for a dinner, sat at the bar. They have a great cocktail list and amazing food. Steak Frites was delicious! Will decinitely come back!"
1,"Went for dinner... Food was amazing, service was great and very attentive... Place was busy!!! Will see you soon Boucherie 🤗"
1,We’ve had a great time in Boucherie. The service was great. We loved the choices of cuts we can have. Highlights for the desserts. The mousse au chocolat is perfect.
0,"Rude bar attendant. Felt very rushed, waitress seemed to constantly glare at us! Cold food. We have been to many hard rock cafes around the globe and this is by far the worst experience we had!!!"
0,What an overrated venue! The staff were horrible! Abrupt and unpleasant. Food was ok if you like spending over the odds for cold food that tastes like it’s straight out of the microwave! Best part was when we left the building!
0,"Stay away! Get a pretzel! We had ordered for 16 people, but ended up at five different tables. And our burgers were some of the worst I’ve ever had! No. Just no!"
0,They need to hire front door/host desk staff that have manners and are trained to be customer friendly. Deplorable.
0,Food was absolutely awful! Tasted like it had been heated in the microwave. Service was slow on a not so busy night. Definitely not worth a visit
0,"Went for lunch, not for the first time here, it will be the last though. The main courses were served when we’d barely started the starters....and the old Veggie burger has been replaced by an inedible cauliflower burger. Simply dreadful."
0,Take my advice and do not visit this venue. It is without a doubt The worst Hard Rock I have been to around the world. If you want bad food at a very expensive price then you will be fine. It is rubbish.
0,"We tried twice to eat here - first time we were told we had to book online, 2nd we were informed they were closing for a private function so we gave up - won't try again."
0,Decor is nice and service is good but that's it. Food was below average and shouldn't be this bad considering the prices. Go to Ellen's instead...much better in my opinion.
0,The food is terrible not that good of space and horrible service not a good place for family only go there if your goth😂

0,"I've been to lots of Hard Rock Cafes round the world and this was the most disappointing. The service was pretty poor, the burgers were really small and the whole experience was simply disappointing. I'd recommend going to Hard Rock Cafe just not this one."
0,I think this is the works Hard Rock Cafe... the facilities are so dark and dirty.. staff aiming for you to leave and the food is the same as ever. Do not recommend it.
0,Little atmosphere and overpriced food and drink. The black bean and quinoa burger was disgusting - they really should come up with a DECENT vegetarian option. Good service. London is a much better venue
0,I really do not underdtand people who like these place ( I know many ) and are happy to buy a 3 usd shirt for 30 bucks just for the logo ! absolute crazyness the food is not gret but not so bad too
0,"Food basic & expensive . Staff welcoming & good service but food a let down , my ribs was luke warm . Would not return"
0,"Sticky tablecloth, no atmosphere, veggie burger wasn't nice, quite expensive for the quality of the food."
0,Waited at fairly empty bar to be served. After waiting over five minutes while bar staff chatted to a customer. Gave up and left
0,The kids were excited about visiting Hard Rock in New York. The experience wasn't good. Staff were unpleasant and the food was the worst we had in North America. Planet Hollywood was so much better.
0,Stopped in as we always visit the Hard Rock wherever we are in the world.. Was greeted by a really rude waitress who had no interest in being kind or helpful. We left and took our custom elsewhere.
0,"Noisy place in basement, cocktails just sugar and ice, almost no alcohol. Friendly service though. Seems popular due to name and location but it feels like a rip-off..."
0,"If you travel all the way to NYC, don't go to a lame restaurant you can visit anywhere. So many better restaurant options in NYC."
0,"Expensive, average food with super slow service. Noisy restaurant with nice music memorabilia. I recommend the restaurant if you have a Hard Rock glass collection with major cities visited or are looking for average food with expensive drinks. Fun but better food at other places."
0,"Expensive, no great food, a lot of noise, typical hard rock cafe but here in NY nothing special! I really can't say more"
0,"This place is by far more a tourist attraction than a restaurant. Over priced average quality food, so many better places to eat in New York. I would recommend people avoid this place for food and just go for the pictures."

0,"Despite the website saying that breakfast was between 9-11am, AND despite being able to book for 10am on the website, we walked in to an empty restaurant only to be told that the hours have changed... thanks."
0,"Food was ok but waiter was deer in headlights, not nice. Many one word answers and overall just unfriendly"
0,iall of us in the were disapointed with the food. A mojito was ordered and had to be returned - bad bad bad.
0,"Visited Saturday 23/7/16. Staff were helpful but we were rushed through our meal literally. As they removed the starter plates, the main course was being put on the table! They wanted us in and out in less than 45 minutes. Food reasonable but not great."
0,"We had the scallop carpacio and the raddish salad. Carpacio was ok. Salad was impossible to eat - intensly bitter. We returned it and still felt that bad taste for an hour later. Good service, nice atmosphere, but unfortunately bad food."
0,"Pizza was cold, the guy checking us out said “thank you for the tip” 3 times before I even paid, have had much better pizza in Charlotte, NC, much less NYC."
0,Well we read reviews that this is the best pizza in NYC. It’s really not. Overpriced average pizza at best. Will not be returning
0,Cold reheated pizza. Bland flavors. Maybe could have been better if fresh out of the oven! Some of the $0.99 options around the city are unfortunately better. Good location and adequate seating options inside and outside. Expected a lot more based on other reviews.
0,"If you like orange oil dripping from your slice all over your paper plate and hands, this is the place for you. See photo of oil already starting to ooze out before I even took a bite."
0,"We were staying at Trump Soho. Told them upon order, then a Spanish speaking only driver was lost and asking where we were. Got to us late, burnt yet cold. Maybe just bad luck for us. We were starving."
0,Huh? We really don't get why this is so popular. It is impossible to find and the pizza was average at best. I expected so much more.
0,The bar was full of seedy people. 40-60 year old guys groping and kissing 20 something bimbos that looked like hookers. Felt like we were in a cheap and seedy gangster hangout in Moscow. Bartenders seemed like they hated working there.
0,One of the worst dining experiences I have had. The food was awfull and overpriced and the service was even worse. Do not go to this restaurant.
0,Stick to the salads - chicken parm at $76 minimum should be delicious but isn't. Not sure why one would want honey and chili on a piece of per-made chicken parm shaped liked a pizza but to each their own.
0,"We order delivery, ham sandwich was wet , the bread, terrible presentation, fried chicken horrible like a stone, broussel sprouts burned, don’t eat with them, we have to trough all."
0,Food was over priced and very average. There are so many better options for Italian food in NYC and most cost far less. Branzino was supposed to be fillet and still had many bones. Other food was mediocre. I won’t be returning anytime soon.
0,"Overpriced. Noisy. The atmosphere was so dark you could barely read the menu or see your food. Our server could barely be heard describing some of the dishes. Service was okay. The only highlight, the bread was delicious."
0,"We went for a family gathering. The lobster was scant, the pasta poor and the dessert not worth ordering. It was expensive and definitely not quality"
0,"We came for a business dinner. Bad decision. We waited 30 minutes post reservation time to be seated, could not hear each other due to terrible noisy acoustic and the food was of ok quality but not great. Overall, a terrible experience"
0,If your want a good meal walk a block and go to the Wayfarer at The Quin Hotel. There is nothing unique at this Italian restaurant. The Caesar was awful the pizza was burned and the sauce tasted canned.
0,"Started out as expected. However, the long black hair weaved around my steak was a bit much. I don't industry paying the inflated prices but this was a little much! Diners beware!"
0,"Arrived in NYC late in the evening. Wanted a light meal after traveling all day with nothing but crappy airline food. They were pretty darn expensive, and had nothing that appealed for under $32 dollars per person. We left and found somewhere else to eat"
0,"Noisy and service with no style. For a top tiered restaurant I would expect better. BTW you could easily drop Italian from the name. As to the food, it was fine."
0,"Nicely decorated, friendly service and grear bread. However, the medium quality and uninspired food which is overly spicy, is lacking precision and refinement characterize a really Excellent Italian food."
0,"Sooo many good restaurant in NYC, go elsewhere. Expensive, salty, loud loud environment, and small drinks, location is great, bathrooms are pleasant, but don't order pizza or mushrooms! Gotta scream to hear anyone and cramped together. I believe that's enough."
0,"Rude bar attendant. Felt very rushed, waitress seemed to constantly glare at us! Cold food. We have been to many hard rock cafes around the globe and this is by far the worst experience we had!!!"

0,I'm drinking a moskow mule at the bar right now. Very bad service. The drink is on the average of nothing. No tip for the guy. He doesn't even say hello to us.
0,"If you want to wait for a while then pay too much for a mediocre burger in really cool looking very crowded surroundings then this is the spot for you. Otherwise focus on the gift shop, buy a Hard Rock pin then head for McDonalds."
0,"Group of 6, bad service, bad food!!!! Burger was dry, and took ages for drinks to come!!! No flavour in any food"
0,Took 30 mins to take first order. Got secon round of drinks wrong after being chased to serve us again The guy (John) was beyond useless Error after error!!!! Worst visit ever. Usually great. Ruined the night.
0,"Bad food and bad service... the fajitas was cold, served in a very sloppy way. The worst was that the burger ordered from the glutenfree menu came with a regular onionring full of gluten. How is this even possible?"
0,"Food was ok. Ran out of steak on a Sunday. Really. Seater was a horrible, person. Major attitude. Made faces behind customers back and when busted made just laughed. Not funny or professional. Management didn't care. Will never go in another hard rock ANYWHERE"
0,"Getting there and getting the first drink was as hard as digging gold! Bad service, food reasonable, baut people in bad will to work doesn't make sense."
0,"My chicken was bloody in the middle, Pop music blasting out, AC far too high place was uncomfortably cold"
0,"I've been to so many Hard Rock Cafe's, this is the worst The Food was cold The aircon was so cold we were shivering eating The guy serving was nice enough Best memorabilia is there for me was Elvis outfit and guitar"

0,"extremely slow service , the food was good but we found a hair in our food !!! that usually ruins the show ."
0,Did not enjoy food was not great Planet Hollywood was far better over priced for what it is Def will not return
0,"busy, rather dirty and dull. we ended up sitting in the old dance floor - food was average and the beer like drinking soap. tables sticky .... very disappointed can't say I'd go back"
0,"I have visited many Hard Rock restaurants before and I am not a big fan but this one top as one of the worst ones. The food and service were terrible. The cheeseburger is their ""main dish"" and it was edible. Not worth the visit."
0,Over priced service is terrible. Breakfast was a shambles would rather of given my money to the tramps outside than to this awful rip off restaurant.
0,HRC NYC is large. Not crowded when we visited the place. Food was classic HRC as expected. Service was not. Our waiter had something to learn about being polite. There are better places to eat in NYC.
0,"So disappointing!!!!! Staff unfriendly, Food crap and bathrooms ABSOLUTLEY filthy dirty!!!!!! Don't waste your time or money!!!!!"
0,"Went for the Breakfast buffet, poor service, terrible food. With so many good little cafés don't waste your money on this place for breakfast. Enough said really,"
0,First time in New York and went here. Service was appalling and food even worse.... Our burger came up still frozen in the middle. Given a $25 gift card to say sorry but this can only be used on food
0,The service and food were extremely poor. They ran out of ice while we were there. Service was slow. Shake was a WASTE of money. Very little shake or alcohol. Hamburger was average tasting. Do not waste your time here.
0,Hard rock fan so it was disappointing to be let down in what should be a flagship restaurant. On duty manager did respond well to our complaint so not all bad

0,Food was not very appealing. I think it's just tired. They need a re-do. Call Gordon Ramsey. ;) Our server was very friendly and professional. I enjoyed the old videos while eating.
0,Nothing spectacular! Service was rather slow and when ordering the large pulled chicken burger. Came on a tiny plate and was cold. Not really impressed for the price. Such as shame as was really looking forward to going here!
0,"We visited because of the fame and the decoration is really nice, but the food, you have multiple better options around. The price, was disprportionated. We won't repeat."
0,Terrible food. Chicken was rubber. The nachos were soggy. One of our friends had to send the plate back. They did take off the cost of the meal.
0,Stopped here for lunch. Not very busy but slow service. My wife had chicken fajitas which were okay but not hot sizzling and appealing. We finished our meal and left disappointed. Probably our most expensive meal of our trip and among the worst.
0,"Very disappointing visit to HRC. Food was lukewarm and the same burger cost $4 more than the Philadelphia restaurant. Service was poor, no atmosphere and even the music was mediocre. We always got to HRC on city breaks but we won't be going back."

0,"If you wanna drop $130 for lunch, then this is the place! This place is way overpriced and the food is below average to average. Flip side is, servers are super nice"
0,Same food as other locations but predictable and good for families. Our server wasn't at all on top of our needs. Mains were served before we were doe with our appetizers. Drinks were gone and we had to ask the manager about getting more.
0,This is a popular place for the very young teenage crowd. The wait time is a bit nuts especially for this type of restaurant!!!
0,"Wen't there for breakfast. For 20 bucks you get slow service, a list of few dishes to choose from and best of all you get to rewards this bad experience with 18% automatic gratuity. First disappointing visit to Hard Rock Cafe."
0,"over priced brekfast, manged to lure me in with wifi only to find out that it didnt work, the food was ok but really expensive for what you get but hey it is what it is"
0,Went for breakfast and it was not good. Both the food and service were not good at all unfortunately. There are many other far better places in the area to go to
0,A once reliable place to go for a decent meal at an okay price. This Times Square location has been a nightmare since it opened. How things have changed since the Hard Rock's 57th Street days and not for the better I'm sorry to say.
0,"Service slow, beer flat, burger tasteless, price high, location great, seating comfortable, decoration good"
0,"Some of the drinks don't have prices on them and we found out why when we got the bill, $17 for 1 average cocktail. We waited a long time for those drinks as well. Tasting platter was ok."
0,"We came into this ""bar"" around 11pm when we found all the bar stools taken. We took other chairs at a table but we were denied these places. So we stood at the bar area but were not allowed to!! Who runs this fake place?"
0,Went here for breakfast. Not much to say other than poor choice and quality of food (served in a buffet style) with an expensive price tag. The redeeming feature would be the building itself which was interesting to take a look around.
0,"This place has nothing on the Orlando one. The low rating is justified. Food was average. Service was slow. Not her fault, she no doubt had heaps of tables to attend to."
0,Very disappointed with this restaurant. Service was slow food very disappointing. Music far too loud. Fancy stuff around the walls but that's it. Avoid
0,"Went to a wedding do there had burgers and a dreadful cheesecake there,poor service,was not busy,plastic covers,a half cooked burger with bacon and cheese ,not good,worst cheesecake ever,no cream or anything with a plain new york cheesecake."
0,We stopped here for a quick meal before a show. Nice food but nothing special. Great location for a pre Broadway bite to eat.
0,Food was very average. Poor beer selection. The atmosphere pails in comparison to other hard rock cafes around the world. And the service? Absolutely shocking!!!!! 30 mins to place an order - 30 mins to get the first round of drinks. Shocking.
0,"Had to try it while in Manhattan. Nothing special, except the service, Danny was a real credit to a very average dining experience. Food was ok but there is so. Much better around,and not at sch a cost."
0,"we waited in the queue for 20 mins to be seated. the music was great, however the food was not worth the wait or the $$ our waiter was very friendly !"
0,"Didn't notice anything special, crazy overpriced. If you're not looking for anything history special place, check out other places with better service and food."

0,"Nearly empty, good service but food nothing special. Wouldn't go again. But out waiter was great, everything looked tired rather than vintage."
0,"Went with our three kids. Waited in line for about forty five minutes. When we finally made it in, service was so-so. Food was more greasy and diner-level. All in all - would not go again, in spite of the nice decor and atmosphere."
0,Two rounds of drinks $60! No wonder the drinks menu doesn't have prices on. Food was OK though but nothing special.
0,"I've been to many around the world and for a great city like NY, I'd expected a little bit more 'bang'! Mild music, under-welmed by the service and mood in the place!"
0,"line was long, food was terrible and waiter forgot our food and brought it to a different table.. Not worth iit."
0,"I like collecting he awesome Hard Rock pins, but the food and service is horrible. In NYC, choose somewhere els to eat."
0,"the food was good but it's very expensive and you have to wait a lot before eating. Probably people go there just to say: ""I've been there"""
0,A good spot for a quick and late bites when nothing is available.
0,"Please do yourself a favor and go someplace else. Hard Rock's can be found all around the world. You are in New York City, explore your options. There are many."
0,Haven't been there in a while because the food it ordinary and overpriced.

0,"The price is outrageous they ask for an”iced coffee” with a scoop of ice cream on the top. 12€. Nevertheless, it is low quality coffee. Strongly avoid this place. This place is a scam."
0,we ordered 4 sweets and two bottles of water and then received a huge bill of 66 €. rude and dishonest employees. absolutely to be avoided
0,24 euros for a cold coffee and à smoothie No card only cash Completly Dishonnest Never go there Avoid it absolutely Ask for price before ordering
0,"Very expensive with no reason, cocktails are far than good. no credit card and no receipt receive. I suggest to not go and to take credits to the reviews on TripAdvisor."
0,The prices do not reflect the quality... For sure a no go place... Just the view was worthy. It seems like that its owner are only evaluating idiots in order to pay these prices.
0,"DON‘T GO THERE! BARGON! ABZOCKE! 1 Ouzo Kaktus 12€... left the restaurant with 88€ having had 4 drinks, 2 desserts. WORST PLACE ON THE ISLAND."
0,"Like others on this site, two of us stopped for water and a coffee each and were charged €32. The iced coffees were €12 each. There was ‘a problem with the wifi’ so no payments by card. Really spoiled our experience of Santorini."
0,"Ripped off like everyone else. Had to pay €8,50 for a coffee and couldn’t pay by card because of bad weather 😂. Offcourse they told this afterwards."
0,Wish I had read the reviews first instead of just walking in. Overpriced for something below average.
0,The worst and the most expensive desert we had. For two old horrible cakes 30€. You can not pay with card. Our mistake that we didn’t check TripAdvisor first.
0,Absurd prices for microwave heated food and old bread. The owner sneakily kept pushing to bring new starters and charged ridiculous prices. Will never go back there. Do not go there.
0,"Ridiculous prices, total rip off, beyond criminal. Owner constantly pushing “appetizers” and other stuff without mentioning the prices, we did’nt take the bait and that mitigated the damage a bit. Food quality is OK but litterally double the price. Dont go here, ever!"
0,"No reviews for a while, hopefully been closed Dow. Just what he deserves. Prices were far too expensive even though it was a lovely view."
0,Great view but terrible service and overpriced.. 20€ for 0.4 juice is too much.. owners where sitting on terrace and listening something on their phone.. no cards only cash.. handwriten bill.. terrible..
0,Ordered an Irish coffee and a glass of wine and we were charged 22 euros... The owner also argued with tourists passing by who were taking pictures... This place is a total rip off

0,"Don’t visit this place ever. Super overpriced, rude employees and dirty surroundings. Just don’t go!"
0,10€ for a small beer and 4€ for a small coke!!!! That says all just skip the hole island it´s just a crappy place with lots of tourist traps. Go to some other greek island.
0,There's nothing I can add that hasn't already been written by others. 25 euro for a 250ml beer and a pina colada with no alcohol. And they smile all the while they're gouging you. Just disgraceful.
0,"Had the most unpleasant visit in a restaurant ever. High prices, bad service, and physical old servant (manager) attacking us when we were leaving... Not good at all. To all of whom this consirns, do not Ever go in this place ever. Rg Jgh HR.!!!!"
0,It is a turisttrap with sick prices. Angry and physically abusive old waiter. Best regards from world travellers.
0,"Free bread and beginning, not free, service was horrendous when asking for help with the menu. Meals where terrible for the price. Should’ve checked trip advisor before going in. All the feedback is all true and nothing changed."
0,"Don't go. They're all smiles at first, they try to push this 'cactus liqueur' cocktail on you which is clearly fruit juice. The coffee is terrible."

0,"138 Euro for 2 appetizers and 2 dishes... “fish of the day” terrible (only lemon taste), moussaka impossible to eat, lamb better not to talk about!!! DON’T GO HERE!!!"
0,Unexpectedly high prices even for such a great view. Tourists must be encouraged to taste Greek dishes but in affordable prices. We are not millionaires.
0,"Beautiful view Vulcan beer 10euro 7euro In the menu house white 10 euro. lovely setting but the pricing is just taking the piss. ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,........................................ Be ware"

0,Overpriced!!! I just saw all the reviews and wish we saw this before we went there. one coffee was 8.50 euros!

0,Over the top prices for cheap nasty food which is clearly frozen from a supermarket. Staff don't seem to smile. Stay away.
0,Very expensive and bad service. We paid for attached fish and chips plate £10 plus £2 for mushy peas. Cheap frozen supermarket food sold with high mark-up!
0,"Visited this establishment recently. The coke was flat and warm, the jacket potato was more like salad and potato never seen anything like it. £44 for 3 practically inedible meals."
0,The worst restaurant - cafe in London and all around the world (and I've been in a lot of cities). Extortionate prices for frozen and bad food. Rude clerks. An embarrassment to London. It should be closed.

0,Absolutely discusting. ..... Over priced.. Very very rude ...... AVOID AVOID AVOID £5 2 cans of pop.. Rude to children who wanted to use toilets
0,"Don't think I'm picky, but I will never be a big fan of British Cuisine. And believe me- it was typical. I tryed a burger with bakon and salat and chips with vinegar."
0,"I will start with the service was very good. The server was friendly and attentive. I cannot remember any time, anywhere when I have ever returned food that I could not eat. The server apologized and removed the item from my bill."
0,We went to the bar to get a drink because Senor frogs does not have table service (not a big deal)... 20 minutes waiting for the bartender to come by and still no service was too long. We left disappointed!
0,If I could give 0 stars I would. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and my husband ordered the shrimp tacos. It was the worst meal that we’ve ever had a restaurant. We couldn’t even eat it. We will not be returning.
0,"$20 for three bland shrimp tacos with two shrimp each with tail intact. $20 chorizo burrito tasted, no kidding, just like Taco Bell."
0,$20 for a steak burrito that has 2 pieces of steak and all beans. Horrible ..$5 extra for more salsa when you order and pay for chips and salsa and run out.. $10 for a warm flat beer.. you can do better anywhere else
0,Was not happy at all. Rude will never go there again nor recommend to anyone. Worst service and rude staff
0,"Honestly, there did was old, cold, and hard. Like they tried to hear it up in a microwave after it sat there all day. Go for the shots but nothing else. Balloon artist was the best thing in the joint."
0,"8:00pm, empty place, but host didn’t allow my girlfriend and me to sit in table (just bar) because we weren’t dining but having some drinks and snacks. It’s Vegas Carlos, my money is good in hundreds of places out there."
0,"2 for 1 frozen margaritas =40 bux As if someone would pay 40 bux for one drink.. no mention of this in advance.. I don't mind spending money, but u hate wasting it..1star for you"
0,"Horrible service, did not come back, mixed up seperate tickets and had to refund cards then redo. Gave wrong ticket in beginning. Never again"
0,"Not the same as other locations. Service was okay, frozen drink machine was not working. Ordered two eleven ounce drinks, $32.00... really disappointing."
0,Are these reviews for real as an earlier person posted people get free drinks for positive posts. It seems strange that almost everyone has names of employees.
0,Too loud Cost too much for quality of food $8.50 for warm Corona eg...$24.99 TacoTuesday tacos & tequila shots....Jose Gold...ugh... If you want extra salsa? $1.00 per 1/2 oz. How does Senor Frog's get such great reviews? We are very disappointed 👎👎👎👎👎👎
0,Avoid this place. At 7pm there were only about ¼ of the tables occupied. That should have been a hint but we went in anyway. Service was OK but food not good and drinks way overpriced - even for a place on the strip.
0,"Mediocre food, very pricy, music way too loud to the extent you can't chat to somebody sat next to you. I should have known it was terrible with how empty it was on a Friday night."
0,"Don't tell the staff there that you have a groupon, they will snub you and tell you that the restaurant is closed.."
0,"Not sure this is actually to be considered a restaurant. Really shabby, bad food and yet quite pricy. I will not be returning. We shall part ways here Señor Frog, and never the twine shall meet again!"
0,Unbelievable. Empty tables all over the place but we are waiting 30 minutes for a table of five. People just walk right past the hostess to take seats. Poorly run. Kids wanted to go. Trust me. Not a place I would recommend.
0,We were craving Mexican so expected Senor Frog's would be a great choice. We had the burritos which were very dry and the Nachos which were soggy and tasteless. Please when in the mood for Mexican look elsewhere.
0,So attended the Saturday Drag Brunch. Paid for VIP seats for seating from 2 to 4. In same line as general admission and still not seated and it's is 230. Staff completely indifferent. Don't recommend it at all.
0,Can you say canned?? The worst!! Go to a privately owned restaurant. Don't waste your money here!! We will not waste any more time here. Server was pleasant food was awful!
0,"Taco Bell has better food. Avoid this place. Expensive, less than average food. Very disappointed and felt ripped off.."
0,"Hostess ignored us and not friendly. Smell was bad. Service was fine, but food was mediocre at best."
0,"Bought the sliders that were described on the menu as juicy Angus burgers. Received pre-pressed dried out discs for $16, with a small amount of fries. TOURIST TRAP!!"
0,Service was terrible wouldn't eat there ever again waited 45 minutes to order food asked to speak with manager waited 45 minutes and all he said was we are busy and service is slow
0,"What a ripoff! 60 for a lousy margarita, and microwaved fish and chips and burrito. Never again. Much better drinks and food at seafood shack next door at TI."
0,"The worst Senor Frog on the Planet!!! No service , the worst restaurant I have been. Avoid at all costs."
0,"Didn't even make it thru the front door, the service was so bad, I didn't want to give them even $1. The door guy was rude, standoffish, unwelcoming and uninformed of about was going on inside the bar"
0,"I have hopefully learned my lesson about the chain, I ate in my 3rd Señor Frog's while in Vegas for the Superbowl. Simply awful service, food was really bad and complaints were met with indifference. Really have no idea how this restaurant continues to survive."
0,Skip this Place as We went there for Dinner and beside having POOR Service the FOOD was AWFUL and Cold to Boot...I've had a Better Meal at Taco Bell !!
0,So loud we had to scream at each other. We ordered beef nachos to share. Made with processed cheese spread and had no flavor! The guac is gray. We asked for more salsa. $3.50? No thank you. Should have walked out.
0,Dying for a margarita-we ventured in. Should have left after I saw all the dirty and uncleared tables. Such a poor representation for fun on the strip
0,We went to Señor Frogs for lunch and I had the 3 little burgers (appetizer). Not much flavour and very dry buns. Rather expensive as well.
0,"Then this is the place for you. Some of the worst food imaginable. Avoid this place like the plague. Oh, and balloon hat guy, ask before you touch someone."
0,What a waste not sure how that could be Mexican food.Tasteless chicken was like not even real chicken.Only good thing was the beer
0,"Very expensive for the rude service, ok food. Extremely loud and obnoxious!! Will never go back!! $47 for two beers and two margaritas. Not worth anyone's time!"
0,"Fajitas were dry and tasteless. I would not recommend eating here. Queso tasted like unseasoned velvita cheese. Waitress was efficient, only positive."
0,"We went in for a quick bite, shared a margarita with an order of chip and cheese. After tip and a hidden restaurant fee our bill was over $60, user beware!!!"
0,It is more if a party place along with treasure island. My chicken chimmi was of pour quality. Seasoning as meant fir spice not flavor. 20 yrs ago it would have been a great place to party. Don't eat here.
0,"Went for lunch, not very crowded, but still a 15 minute wait for a table, got to table and our server came right away... but 20 minutes later no drinks, so we decided to move on without the drinks and got lunch somewhere else."
0,Customer service? non-existent!! bar staff looked rather bored...only interested in tips. Go to Harrah's hotel for outside live music instead!! trust me!!
0,This was by far the worst dining experience we had in Las Vegas. The fish tacos were battered cocktail fish and were pure oil. Service terrible too.
0,Worst food and worst service I've had in LV. Not even worth a quick meal. Frozen Drinks were good and the atmosphere was nice
0,"Drinks served in a phallus? with a tree fond ont eh top? How about just a nice plastic cup - for the grown-ups . The food was awful, but actually the chips and salsa were good."
0,"Food and drinks took a rediculous amount of time. Food was cold, drinks mixed up with another tables. Waiter was more interested in hitting on our wives than bringing us our order."
0,Went in and was disgusted to see bar staff encouraging drinking games and worse still the staff were expected to join in too! Terrible
0,We got a table quickly as not many people in at the time. We were served quite quickly but then we waited and waited and when the meals arrived 2 out 3 were cold. Would not go back again.
0,"We went here twice and were disappointed with the service, the drinks and the atmsophere. We liked Carlos and Charlies at the Flamingo a lot better."
0,"I guess uncensored to me means nude but they weren’t at all, lots of socks and not enough show. Paid almost a hundred a ticket for less then an hour of dancing… were the guys handsome yes but would I do it again no…"
0,"Although they are offering Groupon and are advertising they are open, don't be fooled into thinking it's for food, it's for drinks only. They should make more clear Bar is only open at this time."
0,The food is just ok not worth the price - fun lively atmosphere. We ordered the fajitas very dry and bland flavor.
0,We ate here our first night....it wasnt good at all! Food was below average....bottles of Bud were 7.95....ridiculous!
0,"Looking for a fun atmosphere so went here for drinks and apps. The hostess was a jerk, not nice at all. The bar served blue moon , but not orange slices. Food was average."
0,"Nothing unique about the food. Location was great and no wait to get in. If you just want drinks and nachos, this is your place. Would not recommend for lunch."
0,Sub par. Not worth the money. Food is just okay and over priced. We only went because we had a coupon and it was still more than I valued the experience.
0,"We had tickets for the Drag Brunch and figured we'd kill a little time by getting a drink. Two glasses of water, a mojito and a bloody Mary came to $26. Self service bar pick-up. You be the judge."
0,Way overpriced for sub par mexican food. Save yourself the trouble and go next door to the bbq joint.
0,Good music but not worth the price of entrance. They were charging $33 at the door. If you want Latin music for free just go to Mango Tango and it is 15 mins off the strip tbh.
0,"We came in for dinner to celebrate a birthday and had frozen margaritas. They were weak, watered down and tasted of nothing. The mango margarita was just as bad. Service was good. Food was average. Drinks Horrible. And overpriced. Never again."
0,"Skip it. Bar food poor and over priced. Seemed like they had a ""Latin Night"" going on every night. Drinks like in most Hotel bars were over priced."
0,"would not recommend this place food was bland and took forever to get service. drinks where good, but everything is overprice I recommend buying the groupon deal if you plan to visit here. music was good and great party since"
0,"We originally came in for dinner but the service was so slow getting our drinks that we decided to only order appetizers. Even the appetizers were bad, the nachos were cold and the wings were expensive and not worth it."
0,My group of 6 went for dinner. The food was delish. Stayed for ladies night. Drinks were weak and the bartenders were not very accommodating or friendly at all...
0,"I stayed at TI for 4 days and never saw the inside bar open. I was a bit disappointed, but I am not sure why there was no service."
0,over priced.. save your money. The food took forever and the drinks were over priced. Our server was fine..There are so many better places to have fun in vegas
0,"Did the open bar with 7 others,in total must of been 10 people in the bar ,this has to be the quietest bar on the strip,filled up on the free bar but wouldn't bother again"
0,We stopped for dinner and sat outside. The service was really poor. The drinks were watered down. The food was so-so. The place itself looked dirty and never did find the restroom!
0,After looking at the menu here my group considered leaving for better options. If you're looking for drinks this may be an option. An expensive option. Better to walk a few feet play the slots and drink cheaper.
0,"I've been to coner Mexican restaurants with better quality food. It was dry, tasteless and over priced."
0,Had dinner last night with a friend. Nachos were a bit damp. Burrito was not good at all. Waitress was amazing with great smile and pleasant attitude. Music was very loud.
0,"Even with a Groupon coupon, this joint is way over priced. The food is like all other food on the Strip and a drinks a drink so why charge $30? Try another spot on the Strip."
0,"Our dinner experience was definitely less than memorable. The drinks were not tasty, the fish dinner would have been better quality if I would have gone to Long John Silvers. The service was OK."
0,"The food was just okay, way over priced for what you get! I guess its the location with in Treasure Island that brings people in? The service was about the same as the food."
0,"Not the kind of shack I would stop at for food but a place for a quick drink perhaps. However, be prepared to pay; a (16oz) pint of IPA and a small Coke was 13USD. There are plenty of better value options."
0,It is your typical Senior Frogs. It is not a great restaurant and it doesn't have a great day atmosphere but it is really fun at night.
0,"Enjoyed the place other than the price of the food. Bacon cheeseburger was 20 bucks, did come with fries but was just an average meal. Way overpriced!"
0,OMG! The drink prices were RIDICULOUS. Received a buy one get one free voucher for Senor Frog's but 1 drink was priced outrageously. The environment was like a club and it was not for my personality.
0,"Walking around we were handed a coupon to get a two for one drink. When we went to check it out, the drink was $35. for one. No happy hour, no good deals to eat. Crazy party place wanna be."
0,"Have been to other locations of this chain with much success. Not so much today. They were out of spinach and could not do a chicken Caesar salad. Pretty sad, was shocked they were able to provide my drink."
0,Senor Frog's is the highest priced Mexican food in Vegas and it's not that good. The drinks are $14.00 a piece. Any coupon bought for this will not be enough. Better at Chili's or TGIF.
0,Skip this resturant. Lots of fun if you drink. Check out other mexican resturants that have food. We had fajaitas. Not much meat and chicken. Lots of onions. Very loud !!
0,Food and drink prices are expensive. No complimentary chips before meal. Don't plan on going back. Better Mexican for less at other casinos nearby.
0,"Food was eh, kinda dead instead of party atmosphere, drinks were way too high priced, so many better places in vegas to go to than that"
0,Get a coupon before you get drinks. They are ridiculously overpriced. The bartender we had was a jerk. Waited 10 minutes to get served when they weren't even busy. Food was so-so.
0,Food was bad but expensive. Also we don't like atmosphere and staff quality. We eat there only because other places in the nearby were full.
0,"Horrible service, mediocre food and totally overpriced!! Our server didn't smile once. With all the choices in Vegas I would suggest you skip this place and try somewhere else!"
0,"Second time to give this a try. Arrived in Vegas hungry and once again it was available. Food was cold, poorly prepared ""microwave Mexican"". Overpriced and just not good. Won't be back!"
0,"Drinks were average vegas price, but watered down so really not worth the money. I've had better mexican food at del taco. NOTHING for vegans and very little for vegetarians."
0,"I thought the food was regular chain restaurant fare and way overpriced, the service was good, maybe worth doing once, but no big deal if you miss it"
0,"We stopped at a Senor Frogs in Puerto Rico and loved it, had the best time. This one was dead, very slow service, and no great waitstaff or food. :("
0,Local beer is overhyped and expensive so be aware of what you are ordering. The food selction is not very healthy even the salad would feed 3 people and comes in a fried tortia shell.
0,Was surprised at how expensive the drinks were. Senior Frogs in Cancun was always well priced. They had $20 drinks that were pretty weak with alcohol. It thought is was a poor value even for Vegas.
0,There was a live band playing when we entered. Our group stayed for about five mintues and then left as you could not have a conversation - the venue is too small for a live band.
0,Not the fun time you'd expect from a senior frogs. The waitstaff was too busy chatting with each other and texting to pay attention to the customers.
0,"People are making a big deal about their beignet. It’s like eating elephant ears from a carnival. Cash only. So don’t make the line if you don’t have cash. July 19,2021."
0,"While the beignet is very simple, there’s something about Cafe du Monde that just makes them meh. Totally different experience at the main location during Covid, with shortened hours, no waitstaff."
0,Just know there is a long walk and a long line to a very busy part of town where this café is located.
0,Overrated donuts. Save yourself some calories and standing time and skip this. These glorified donuts are just fried dough without any character. Lots of wasted powdered sugar that stains your clothes.
0,"The beignets were terrible. Not well cooked; not light and fluffy; raw dough in the middle. Haven’t been here in a number of years. Very disappointed about the quality decline, especially after the 30 minute wait in line."
0,"Yes, it's famous. And it's filthy. Too much powdered sugar and a terrible texture. If you want a delicious beignet, do Cafe Beignet on Bourbon Street. It's well worth the wait."
0,What is the big thrill? The servers are rude ... it’s noisy and if you like fried dough .. fine but this is not a place to go out of your way for ...
0,"Why anyone would visit this disgusting, filthy dump a SECOND TIME is beyond me. One star rating only because you can't show zero - joke!"
0,"Made a special trip to Cafe Du Monde for their infamous beignets, was so disappointed. The flavor was bland, and the dough was dense and chewy. Do not recommend."
0,I know it is iconic but terrible coffee. Terrible donuts. Crowded. Icing sugar over the floor. Up my nose
0,I can't complain about the food or the service. But this place is not worth visiting as any coffee shop can offer more.
0,"Absolutely terrible service. Don’t come here if you have any anxiety, they’re rude, dismissive and DIRTY!!! You will be eating off of filth. Enjoy."
0,Sat down and didn’t get served for almost 15 minutes so we left. The people working there just kept walking past the table while other workers were sitting on the table next to us and didn’t do anything.
0,"Seriously, 40min waiting in the line just to have expensive beignets similar to other ones you can have in other places. You can't pay with card, only cash, and you don't know until you have done the line. Even the coffee is f.. Expensive"
0,Cashier had tons of attitude and zero concept of customer service. I’m surprised that her behaviour is not being pulled up and addressed.
0,You can get fresher beignets and better coffee at places less crowded and with far shorter lines! This place is way overrated!
0,How can this place be world famous? Beignets were hard and way overcooked. Everyone was leaving them on the table. Service staff did not seem happy to be there. Tables were not clean. Not worth the time.
0,"Bathrooms atrocious, staff looked unenthusiastic about everything and the giant Pablo Escobar sized table with powdered sugar in an open kitchen was a bit concerning...fly’s in beignets anyone??? I don’t know what the beignets taste like, I wasn’t brave enough to try..."
0,"Bathrooms atrocious, staff looked unenthusiastic about everything and the giant Pablo Escobar sized table with powdered sugar in an open kitchen was a bit concerning...fly’s in beignets anyone??? I don’t know what the beignets taste like, I wasn’t brave enough to try..."
0,"Too busy, dirty and rubbish service. There are great places in the French Quarter. This is no longer one of them."
0,Filthy... unorganized... staff not polite... our server assumed a tip; I had to stop her and say: Hey... My change please! Had beignets at 3 different places; all about the same to me....
0,Over rated and dirty there are much better beignets other places that are a lot more sanitary but everyone has to have their own experience at least once
0,"Unless you are a large, touristy-looking group, don't bother. The service is terrible and the waitstaff is rude.....unless of course, you are a large group. Is is just an icon."
0,It was smelly and chaotic. The beinets were not great. We took a bite and then left. Somewhere to tick off the New Orleans list but not somewhere to recommend or return to.
0,"The line was around the block and the beignets we're not that great and the bathroom was dirty. We had the most awesome beignet sticks across the street at Monty's restaurant. Try it on your next trip, you will not be disappointed."
0,Bill was $12. Gave two $10’s. He tried to give me $3 change! WATCH YOUR MONEY!!! Very sad! Petite Asian male waiter - BEWARE!
0,The donuts are not very well made and the coffee is sub-standard. Toilets are not clean. Any donut shop would be 10 times better than these donuts.
0,Service = rude. Coffee and beignets = very ordinary. Toilets = disgusting. How anyone can recommend this dump is beyond me. One star (minimum you can give) is too much - should read zero!
0,Just didnt like beingets. They are messy and flavorless and according to the locals these are the best in town. Skip it.
0,I asked for coffee in milk and they just make regular coffee and put half and half. It taste awful. There is not much to say about fried dough with tons of powdered sugar.
0,Not worth the hype people aren’t friendly smells bad it’s just fried dough but they give you more sugar then dough don’t waste your time
0,Something you have to do once but do it when there is no wait as it is not worth lining up for. The coffee is watery but the hot chocolate was surprisingly good.
0,"Very delicious but very over rated. Long lines, dirty/sticky tables, cash only. Other places have delicious beignets but have much better coffee and atmosphere. Basically, I’m glad I went but won’t be back. It is historical and special but not worth the trouble."
0,Terrible beignets!!!’ Nothing French about the beignets what so ever. Coffee was awful too. DIsguised under a mountain of powdered sugar. BEST beignets and coffee are at Teddy’s in the Roosevelt hotel - flakey and served elegantly with chocolate sauce.
0,My friend highly recommended this place. Said they had the best beignets in the city. They were very hard. I would give it a 1 out of 10.
0,My third visit to Cafe Du Monde and man was that a disappointment. The normally puffy & light beignets were heavy thick globs raw dough inside powdered sugar covered gut bombs. They were horrible. Not at all what I remembered from previous visits. YUCK!
0,Riverfront shopping centre location. Lots of seating but beignets overbooked. We heard that the other location may be better.
0,Coffee was very bland. Beignet was very thick and cake like. I thought it would be light and crispy.
0,"Appalling service, dirty tables, tasteless beignets topped with a mountain of sugar, lukewarm poor coffee. Avoid this place, it is just a tourist trap."
0,"Fried dough with a pound of powdered sugar was nothing special to me. SORRY, I dont get the hype! The waitress invites you to sit at a dirty ass table, and takes your order as she clears the dishes. I definitely could've skipped this."
0,Beignets were too dense and heavy for my liking...................tourist trap! There are local restaurants with better Beignets.
0,"We sweet sat at a dirty table and waited for 22 minutes before anyone cleaned off our table. Food and coffee were amazing, but service not so much."
0,Waited over 10 minutes waitress never spoke or made eye contact. Would give lower rating but not allowed. Made special trip too try . Never coming back not worth the hype .
0,"so sad that such a well known resturant would have such rude waitstaff and filthy restrooms. Not just rudeness and filthy toliets but only 1 line that we were ordered to stand there, wait in line, stay out of the way!"
0,"it was very disappointing, ok coffee with an overrated donut with sugar on top! this was probably once a lovely cafe but now I don't know why people queue to get in to this place. don't waste your time and money."
0,Service is barked and rushed. Coffee was BAD after drinking French truck and beneights were like glorified funnel cakes( the frozen kind).
0,"If you want a fried pastry that tastes like burnt frier oil covered in powdered sugar, this is your place. I try to only write positive reviews but not only our family, but several others were really disappointed. Maybe it was a bad night?"
0,Don’t bother. Long line to get in. Shuffle you in and out. Mediocre beignets. Go to Cafe Beignet a block away. Poor service.
0,Not worth the wait. A two-block line? Really? Not when there are so many other places to get great Beignets.
0,"Rude staff, terrible service , awful beignets. Tourist trap. Dirty. All staff oriental, why? Skip this place."
0,Every time we went for four days the line to get in was out ragous So that was disappointing I really want to try it
0,"After the wait, we got the baignets, I was so looking forward to it - what a disappointment. The dough was gummy and not fully cooked inside. I would not recommend this place to anyone!"
0,Don’t waste your time. Nostalgia got the best of us. Not impressed. Dry and over cooked beignets. Don’t fall for it.
0,"I had rude waiters, and no bussers. I had to seat myself, and clean off my table. I paid $3.00 for a 8 oz bottle of warm milk...ridiclous!!! THIS IS MY LAST TIME THERE!!!"
0,Terrible service and bad coffee The beige nets were ok . It’s hot there and no AC. It’s really not a must see cafe!
0,"Really? Service was downright rude and terrible. Asked for coffee, but didn’t get it. God forbid I asked for another cup. Never again."
0,"Quality of the place has declined. Tough beignets, watery coffee, and dirty. Not the fairytale place it was."
0,Friendly staff and relaxed atmosphere. Wee went to try the bfamous beignets but they were disappointing.
0,"The bignets were way too dense, not as light and fluffy and crisp like I remembered. Seems like they are just pumping them out now and quality is not a concern."
0,Not really sure what all the hype is about??? We drink coffee all over North America and this had to be the worst...so bitter we couldn't even drink it! The donuts were like shoe rubber and dry! Awful!
0,We went at 11 pm and were so excited to try only to find out delicious treats were raw and doughy inside. So disappointed.
0,"We had the beignets and house coffee. Cannot comprehend why these are so popular other than for the location. Chewy, doughy, bland. Eat there just to get the experience of being there on Decatur St. but not for the pastries."
0,Service was great but beignets was terrible!!! We went to New Orleans so many times and every time we stopped at Cafe Du Monde the beignet is getting worst!!! But hey hot water costs $3!!!
0,"I could have put up with the crowds, dirt and harassed waiters if the doughnuts were good but they were a huge disappointment. I just don’t understand why this place is so highly rated."
0,Not only was the beignet and cafe au lait sub par but the service was terrible. Bad food worse service!
0,"Food was ok, but the attitude of the staff was terrible.They looked like they had all been fired and we working out the day. No greetings or acknowledgments of any sort. This was the Cafe du Mond in the mall."
0,Tried the famous Cafe au Latte and three beignets Sadly the fame of this resturant and their product did not live up to the fame. Cash only. This is my second attempt at beignets. Plenty of powdered sugar but no other flavor. Sorry
0,"Compared to 15 years ago on our last trip, the beignets were a real disappointment this time. Not worth it"
0,"While taking a city tour of New Orleans, our guide informed us that Cae du Monde has the WORST beignets in the entire city!! They compare it to a drive through McDonalds... with the cheapest ingredients! Skip this place!!!!"
0,"Although the beignets were tasty.. the coffee was terrible. Whole restaurant is shabby, dirty and in need of renovation. The restrooms were appallingly filthy. We were sorely disappointed having heard so much about this New Orleans ”landmark”. Not worth the trip. Needs major upgrade!"
0,I had been there many years ago and was so excited to return. Well it was nothing like what I had experienced before. The place was filthy. Horrible service and the beignets undercooked. Never again.
0,i do not do milk in my coffee need at least half and half also there are other places that have beignets without long lines very overrated
0,"Wow, all this fuzz cuz of some bread with powdered sugar.....not worth it. The menu is on the napkin dispencer....coffee, juice or water......and the bread."
0,While waiting for a table I stood in line to use the bathroom. Door to bathroom was in room where the dishes were washed! Bathrooms were filthy! Decided not to eat there!
0,"This place may have been good in the past, but now they serve horrible coffee, and the beignets are not that good"
0,"What a nightmare! The place holds about 500 people and they have 2 bathroom, with one toilet each. Both bathrooms were disgusting and the line over 30 minutes. Why doesn't the property owner build out clen new larger bathrooms? I will never return."
0,There are better places for beignets than this tourist trap. Floors and restrooms are filthy. Cafe beignet is quieter and cleaner. Their beignets are bigger and tastier. Loud dirty and not worth the hype.
0,"Awful - clearly money laundering activity takes place in this establishment. Terrible service, dodgy coffee."
0,Everyone has wanted so long to get their beignets from Cafe du Monde but really they aren’t that good. They are way too overrated.
0,We waited for thirty min in the heat for a table only to find out once seated that this place only takes cash. What a joke. We were starving and left and walked two block and found a great little pub.
0,"The service was fine. The beignets were a complete disappointment. fortunately, the place wasn't busy, so we didn't have to wait. The beignets were dry with almost no flavor."
0,"Only try one time , is to sweet. Is good when you need sugar for your body. So sweet , nothing special."
0,"Seriously this is a cafe with crap decor full of believers... For what? A doughnut? Suggest you sneak around to Cafe Beignet in Royal it is quiet, classy and easy to get a table. Avoid the tourist trap!!!"
0,"Nothing exceptional, dirty place the mugs were not clean properly. Deep fried bignet with lots of sugar on it, Never again."
0,We stood in line for 30 min when I got to the front of line I was told they only had soda That's right soda nothing but soda!!!! Let us wait in line. They will never get me back ever!!!
0,Ridiculous. In and out like cattle. Kitchen was disgusting. You can do better elsewhere. Don’t even ask about the restroom line.
0,"Three little beignets- plain with icing sugar ($3) and coffee ($3) is all they basically serve. Poor service! I have no idea why it is so popular! If they serve anything else, we never got a menu!"
0,Really!!!!! Fried dough like at the local country carnival or one in the Walmart parking lot. A real tourist trap.
0,"Highly overated place with the worst coffee you can ever drink, the bignets are just okay, just surviving on past glory and nostalgia. I would not recommend going there."
0,"For it being such a staple, I was not impressed. Staff were not friendly, beignets were undercooked. Coffee was OK. Sad..."
0,"Went to Cafe Du Monte as everyone says is a must. I found it dirty, coffee and hot chocolate were horrible and beignets were better down the road at Cafe Beignet. I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
0,"It is the best place to eat Beignets everybody says. Buts not. Staff and kitchen look like a mess, not clean. There is only one thing centric, make money. Staff is busy with themselves. You want Beignets go to Cafe Beignet a block away..."
0,The beignet’s were heavy and laden with powdered sugar…. They were barely warm. They have also gotten smaller. There are much better in the city.
0,It boggles the imagination that the Cafe is unable to better run the kitchen for less time standing in lines.
0,Used to be a wonderful spot but now it’s all about turnaround and coffee and beignets aren’t that good anymore
0,"Walk up, order beignet, sit at a dirty table and claim the “experience”. Not much to it. This is one place that has a famous reputation that is pretty weak."
0,"Due to the pandemic and popularity, most beignets are prebagged and are not very fresh like I’ve had on past trips."
0,"Table busing is horrible. Floor is unkept. Trashy overall, except for inside. 5 empty dirty tables and no place to sit! Too filthy for me. Doughy beignets! No waiters! Very disappointing for a New Orleans native. Wish Morning Call was back in action."
0,I’m not sure what the bid deal is it’s bite size funnel cake. The coffee is so-so. If it is your first time here it’s something you have to do. I will not be doing it again.
0,"Yes, if you visit New Orleans, you have to visit Cafe du Monde, right? This was my second visit but I really think it’s overhyped - the crowds were ridiculous, the service unfriendly, the coffee overpriced and the beignets mediocre at best."
0,"We fell for the hype. Greatly disappointed, found better ones elsewhere. The beignets were nothing special."
0,"I understand with covid that business is slow, but we got cold, hard, old beignets in a bag. We did our obligatory visit as first time tourists in New Orleans, but would never go back."
0,"Our group personally preferred Cafe Beignet, better beignets, kind, caring staff, and Cafe Beignet is quaint and clean."
0,"Not impressed with the beignets, too dense. I hope the quality gets better again as tourism picks up in the area. Also, overkill on the powdered sugar. Frozen cafe au lait hit the spot."
0,Not up to par with previous visits. The beignets were basically tough dough on the inside. Very disappointed.
0,"The coffee is terrible, as were the beignets. The people were rude.The only good thing about the place is the location. Go to Cafe Beignet instead. The food is much better, and so is the service."
0,"Facility is currently staffed by a very rude, all Asian female staff. Beignets were great!! Coffee was fair."
0,"Beignets are Good... menu very simple Coffee & beignet.... Lines can be long - go early... staff some are hard to understand & speak quickly, not very friendly"
0,So overrated. Tastes ok and the coffee is bad. The smell of the place was so bad. And they only accept cash for payment!
0,"Too crowded, too sweet and doughy, and unpleasant ambiance with pigeons everywhere. Quick service does not compensate for the downfalls."
0,"Long lines mixed with rude employees=bad experience. The cafe au lait was good, the beignets were not that great. We’ve had much better at other establishments."
0,"Cafe Beignet is better. So much better. These people are rude, coffee drinks outrageously priced & beignets are flat as a pancake. Wouldn't eat them again."
0,"Good beignets if you like birds flying all around.... not very sanitary to me. Dirty tables, server put finger in powdered sugar. Not good experience"
0,What a scam. “French” place that would go out of business in less than a week in France. Beignets are pathetic and barely edible. Nothing to see there.
0,People rave about these. Didn't love them. Too heavy. Too doughy. Too much icing sugar. We got ours to go. Ended up giving them away. Could be that we expected something different. Could be that we are doughnut snobs. But this wasn't for us.
0,"The takeout line was very long. We entered on the side for outside dining and a table was available within 5 minutes. The waitress immediately cleaned our table and took our order. Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the beignets."
0,After waiting in the extraordinary line for a cup of the class black coffee and chicory what a disappointment. Could just be my flavor preference but wife got a mocha coffee which she normally loves and had to throw it out. Recommend any other coffee.
0,Had to leave service was slow. Dirtiest place I've been to in years. Health inspector should check it out
0,+ Good coffee but overpriced - We did not like the Beignets there - Filthy location (bathroom visit definitely to be avoided)
0,"Place needs to be clean, the taste of coffee was not we were expecting. Too comercial, we expected a warmly place"
0,"Love the coffee and Beignets BUT cleanliness is terrible. The restrooms are horrific, filthiest I’ve ever experienced. There are many options in NOLA for coffee and beignets, I’d find a place that’s clean."
0,The place was recommend as a must try but I would have done good without trying. The food and coffee was over rated.
0,I didn’t like the Beignet or didn’t feel anything special about their taste. Too much sugar dumped on the fried dough that is all.
0,We went in the evening. The beignets were gummy and the tables were far from clean. Don’t waste your time going there!
0,It’s just ok. It’s a donut with too much sugar. My sugar kid loved it. Just got take out as line shorter. Terrible coffee.
0,"It’s a great location overlooking Jackson Square, but that’s the best thing to be said. We had four coffees and a couple of beignets. The service was terrible and the coffees came in polystyrene cups."
0,They were very dense and heavy. The worker poured so much sugar into our to go bag that I had to ask for a container to dump out the sugar
0,The place is super filthy and for flavor’s sake change the oil more frequently. Overrated tourist trap.
0,"We did the stop off on the 2nd location , not 1/2 as good as the original Cafe Dumond , pretty disappointing, the original in the french quarter has better service too."
0,"So so coffee and beignets overloaded with icing sugar. Neither healthy or enjoyable. Great venue , pity about the hyped offering."
0,"Inpolite and bored staff, no paymenr by card possible, the cafe has absolutely no charm - mass processing. Really disappointing."
0,"I was really looking forward to going there. But the line was very kind was very long, the employees were rude and the beignets were tough. We got better ones in the airport"
0,server did not speak English we ordered two iced coffees we got two flat whites so after lots of ''discussion'' and pointing to menu we finally got what we ordered they only take cash(highly unusual in USA) highly overrated cafe
0,"Unfriendly staff, dirty floor & tables. Basic menu. It is what it is: don’t expect too much from it: it’s just a box that you have to tick when you come to NOLA."
0,This place used to be great. And their beignets are still good. But it’s now very over crowded with “don’t-care” service.
0,"As I wrote in the title, there is Nothing taste that good in this shop, but it is a very convenient place to rest and have a drink, so every one goes there for a break"
0,"Go to Cafe Beignet. Way better. Lighter, crispier dough, and not so much 'show' with the powdered sugar."
0,"Unfriendly staff, dirty floor & tables. Basic menu. It is what it is: don’t expect too much from it: it’s just a box that you have to tick when you come to NOLA."

0,"I was so excited to try cafe du Monde, the beignets were just ok, the service was very average and the toilets were disgusting. Cafe beignet had far superior service and tastier food and atmosphere."
0,"On vacation in New Orleans and had a mandatory visit to Cafe Du Monde. Enjoyed it all, but the restroom was disgusting. We told our server and asked to see a manager. Nothing happened. Apparently they don’t care about such things. Pee before you go!"
0,Chewy and old oil. Way over hyped. Tourist trap and very difficult to get a table. Beware cash only.
0,coffee was very poor!!!! the famous Beignet is actually fried dough coated with huge amount of powdered sugar!! and that's it!!
0,"Beneigts with ten pounds of sugar, so much that I got it all over me just trying to eat the thing. Loud, staff looked like it could care less. Smelly homeless hanging out nearby. Waste of time."
0,Not worth the long wait to get in. It's fried dough with powdered sugar that you eat with a hundred other people
0,"Very busy and overcrowed, it feels like a fastfood restaurant. Too much sugar on the beignets (... and on the table and floor). At any fairground stall in Belgium you will have much better beignets. The iced coffee was just cold coffee."
0,"Really is a place I’d you want fried biscuits and sugar powder, we went in and out! no line in the afternoon, however server was not available."
0,Nothing worth standing in line for more than an hour just to get a coffee and baked sugary bread. Also forget the word clean in this place.
0,Nothing special. Service is ok but pressuring a lot for tips. Beignet are nothing compared to the French onces. Place smells bad and bathroom is diaguating
0,I was excited to try these but was really disappointed. They were light and seemed tough. Disappointed!
0,If you are willing to wait in the line for 45 minutes for a powder sugar donut go ahead. Btw only drink the bottle water. Place is extremely unclean
0,"It´s a place that basically serves one dish, it was filthy and overcrowded, and the service was terrible"
0,Service was very slow tables were dirty and rest of the establishment was also wait staff could not understand order and wanted tip when Bill was paid no receipt was given for charges
0,"Really overrated !! Rude staff, cash only, no receipt , overpriced, I really don’t know what the fuss is!!! Other less famous places offer better quality coffee and beignets. Just disappointed, perhaps I expected toooo much in the first place ."
0,"Hot, overcrowded, dirty, and unpleasant is the best description of the atmosphere. The beignets are a disappointment too. Overly doughy and chewy, covered with too much powdered sugar, our hotel had much better beignets."
0,This place was filthy inside and out and don't even get me started on the bathrooms. It makes me wonder how the kitchen looks. Definitely needed more staff cleaning tables and the ground.
0,It's a tourist trap! No need to prioritise this place. Food isn't too expensive though. What more do you need to know.
0,"Crowded & is expensive! Lots of places serve the beignets and the service is better, friendlier and the other way laced are cleaner!!!"
0,Had been told that this was the place to go but can honestly say I was disappointed. On finding a table we had to clear and clean the table ourselves while a waiter sat less than 3 feet from us. Won't rush back
0,This cafe is extremely popular and unfortunately it has turned into a conveyor belt of guests and exhausted staff who seem to have lost the art of smiling. Tables left cluttered due to staff obviously being overworked and tired out. Would not recommend.
0,The Beignet was ok. The coffee was awful. The place was sticky and dirty. Our server barely spoke english. Having never been there and always hearing about it...I guess I pictured a lovely little cafe with fluffy beignets...but that is not what you get...disappointed.
0,We weren’t impressed. Not authentic at all. The service was not very friendly and nothing French about it.
0,"It is something you have to do, but......was just fried dough to me and the coffee was nothing special. Cash only. Wouldn’t go again."
0,"Beignets are great, but really not that special. They’re cheap, so at least it’s not a rip off. Service is eager. The entire outdoor seating area smelled intensely like vomit - really puts a damper on things."
0,We ate beignets at 3 different restaurants while in NOLA. This was by far the worst of the 3. Tasted stale and dry with one cup of powdered sugar in a bag. Threw them away after a bite. Overrated
0,"Living off the history ! Not worth the line and time spend there, Coffee is awful, the Beignets staled and place dirty. Best serve by taking a photo next to the sign and having your coffee and beignets some other place. Cash only also!"
0,"Busy place , food limited to New Orleans tastes. Plenty of sugar and deep fried.. nothing European about it."
0,I’ve had beignets in other places and was looking forward to coming to the “home” of the pastry and eating them there. Unfortunately I thought the beignets we got at cfe dumonde were tourist fare.......
0,It was fine but definitely nothing special. The coffee was excellent but find something else for your sugar fix
0,Service was terribly slow and must have been a half dozen bussers just sitting around playing on their iPhones. Still don't accept credit cards. Beignets were cold and tasted old. Bathrooms were disgusting.
0,For us it was nothing special as you can get that kind of sweets in Europe. Sugar on the sweets was way too much. The lines were massive and the place inside was quite dirty. Don't understand what makes that place that special.
0,"Overrated. We definitely could have skipped this. Rude waiter literally rolled his eyes, it’s just dirty & the beignets weren’t that great. Things to know: you seat yourself, don’t wear black (powdered sugar gets everywhere) & cash only."
0,I don't understand the hype. The baugett was good but the noise and the crowds take away any fond memories. Take a picture of the cafe and move on.
0,"Okay, how hard is it to carry a box of tea bags for those of us who don't drink coffee? We left and won't come back because a beignet without a hot beverage is too dry. Cafe Beignet next door is a better choice."
0,"Long lines, not really worth it. Just a fresh donut with a ton of powdered sugar dumped on them. Pass"
0,"It must be a landmark, so it’s famous. But the coffee and the beignets and the seating environment, only good for taking a picture to proof you have been there, not worth to wait or to try."
0,Go to cafe beignet instead!! Tourist trap all the way! And live music! Fresh cooked beignet and great ambiance
0,"We made a super long line and waited for a table in this overly crowded sardine can. Then we waited even longer for flavorless fried dough covered in powdered sugar and watered down hot chocolate. It just isn't worth the wait, or the weight."
0,"this place has gotten so much hype that it is super crowded, the beignets are crunchy on the outside and gummy on inside. 28 years ago they were the best now not so much. Coffee au Lait was good."
0,"Unless you are just crazy about Beignets - save your time. Long lines, overwhelmed staff. The Beignets are lovely, but this NOLA must-do is a must-skip unless you just want to say you were there. Lots of other great options to satisfy your sweet tooth."
0,Not worth the hype beignets were chewy. The atmosphere was great. The coffee au late was good but small
0,We stayed in line for the famous Beignets but frankly they were just ok. Also not that I love Beignets
0,Why so many people queue for so long for a cup of bland coffee and deep fried dough covered with icing sugar beats me. This was a recommendation of one the best things to do in NOLA that I regret listening to.
0,This Iconic cafe has really slumped the service was unfriendly and short the beignets were chewy and cold and the place has lost all charm what a shame. the coffee was good
0,"I was looking forward to trying these better than don't pastries and then dry, flavorless, messy thin layers were hard I'm just hoping these weren't fresh."
0,This place is famous but it is very touristy and trashy. Coffee is weak. There are better coffee shops to have a good beignet.
0,"Large place, but every time we stopped by there was a long line. We passed, and went to another place for our beignet fix. Maybe a different time of day would have been better."
0,"The line was ok, maybe 15 minutes. Seated wait was maybe 20. No problem. But the beignets were tough, chewy and without flavor."
0,A tourist favorite and always a long line of people. I found the beignets over priced and so so in taste and quality. The white sugar was not enough for the bready beignets I would have liked a filling injected
0,Tar flavored COFFEE and powdered sugared dough are not for me. HOWEVER a lot of people line up dow the block to spend their money.
0,Had the house specialties after walking around a packed sitting area. Dirty tables very cramped. In my opinion not worth the hassle.
0,"Family trip to NOLA. Walked from our hotel. The city was not yet awake, but lots of people there already. It was fun, but overpriced. Hot chocolate tasted cheap and was disappointing. Place was packed and when we walked by later there was a line."
0,Good cultural experience. Wonderful Beignets. Good service. The most FILTHY BATHROOMS in the French Quarter
0,Terrible coffee with really bad service. One of those places that don’t deserve its reputation. There are only that many words you need to describe a bad place.
0,"The only good think are the beignets, the rest it was disapointing, full of people, no space, bad service"
0,The seating was a tent-like atmosphere. Very busy. Toilets filthy. Too bad the amenities are so lacking as it is located at the edge of the Frennch Market and Jackson Park.
0,We found the beignets a bit greasy and disappointing and our waitress wasn’t helpful. I think it’s an institution but not necessarily the best place to eat.
0,I don’t think it’s worth the wait. Very crowded and noisy and unfortunately the beignets are not very good (I think they tasted like old grease). I had better beignets at the gumbo festival and at the snack shop in one of the parks.
0,"Yeah the beignets are great, but that’s were it’s stops. Coffe is terrible, service is the worst and is crowded as heck.... skip it, go to the outlet mall instead."
0,Came here with high expectations. Left extremely disappointed. Coffee middle of the road. Beignets good but just that. So many people hyped this place up to me but I just don’t get the appeal.
0,Super crowded... Rude staff... Same coffee can be found elsewhere.... Found fluffier and tastier beignets a block away... Long line-ups... Ridiculous restrooms... Tourist trap
0,"If you like greasy doughnuts with to much powder sugar and chicore coffee well, this place is for you. Line ups are sooo long on weekend, can't understand why as nothing else is offered on the menu. It was a real desapointment."
0,"We had lovely coffees and the Beignets were delicious However, the ladies rest room was dirty and smelly.The floor was sticky and the basin was slimy. Would not recommend.Spoiled an otherwise nice experience."
0,This is a famous tourist staple but go once and never again. Service is awful and they don’t have any options ie. no dairy free milk which nowadays is a must! Much better beignets elsewhere!
0,I thought going to this historic place we would receive some sort of hospitality. Nope. Short and rude. Food was good but I don't ever have to visit again.
0,It is the McDonalds of beignets! Go to cafe beignet they are great!no more to say no no no no no cafe beignet
0,"Really disappointed with this place.... it looks really run down and after the ridiculously long wait and rude staff, the beignets are ok good but you can get the same quality or even better variants in other places in town."
0,"It's basically fried bread with powdered sugar on it. It doesn't taste bad, it just kinda is what it is. But the hype about this place is kind of ridiculous."
0,"It was very crowded and they do not have cream for coffee only milk. The beignets were tasty, they are basically fried donuts without a hole and lots of powder sugar"
0,The Beignets are overrated! I personally didn’t like them. The cafe only serves beignets and some beverages.
0,Cafe Du Monde is not what it used to be. Beignets are doughy and thick. They used to be light and airy. Very disappointed.
0,A lot of fuss made over a donut with too much powdered sugar on it. Not worth standing in s long line in the heat of the day. Go early if you go!
0,"While in New Orleans for a bachelor party we stopped as it’s one of those “must do” things in the quarter. Prices are reasonable, but it’s just a dense powdered sugar donut. Not as good as the hype would lead you to believe"
0,We were looking forward to the beignet. It was overpriced and not good. A friend commented they changed the recipe after hurricane Katrina.
0,We stopped by cafe du monde to try the famous beignets. The beignets were tasteless greasy blobs of batter coated in powdered sugar (very messy to eat). We tasted and threw the rest away. Not recommended as a ‘must do’ in New Orleans.
0,"fast waiter, resonable pricing- cleaning absolutely recommended!!! Cleaning of the tables and the floor should be definatelly improved!!!"
0,Over rated!! Not impressed. Long hot wait. Beignets were too thick. They won’t give you a box to take home Beignets. No need to ever return.
0,"Beignets are good, but this is all they serve food wise. Must wait in line for a table then hunt down a waitress to clear and clean said table."
0,I’m not a fan of waiting in line for food especially in a town known for having amazing cuisine. I think people go here because it’s in the guidebooks.
0,"The food and coffee was nice and not too expensive, however our waiter was very rude. After being directed to sit at a dirty table, our waiter refused to answer any of our questions and either completely ignored us or said “read the menu”."
0,"Disappointment abounded during my visit to this iconic cafe. Dirty, chaotic, and mass produced beignets made me wish I skipped this stop. I advise you find a smaller establishment that cares about the quality of their product."
0,Last time I was here was more than decade ago and I loved it then. On this visit the waitress was very rude and the beignets were overcooked and hard. Coffee was good.
0,"Was okay food good service sucked waitress didn’t even smile. Not worth the wait,to many better places to commercial."
0,Can’t fit more than 3 to a table. Nobody was helping customers we were all just wandering around. Too hot for outside eating with no fans or ac
0,"Definite worth going one time just to say you’ve been, but it’s definitely for the tourists. We had the unfortunate bad luck of having the most surly waitress, also with an accent that was most difficult to understand. Cash only!!"
0,The beignets were not light and fluffy like how I remember them from the first time I tried them here decades ago. We were disappointed. May have been because we came late at night.
0,"The beignets we thick and heavy, not light and airy. Too crowded, though the line may have moved quickly, it felt rushed to eat and get out."
0,I've had better... we're too dry and had a baking soda after-taste. This was based on the river walk location.
0,"I heard a lot about the café DumondeAnd wanted to try it. It is in an excellent location right next to Jackson Square and the oldest Catholic cathedral in North America. The food was OK, but I would never wait in those lines again."
0,You guys desperately need a new bathroom it’s absolutely disgusting they are old and smelly makes you almost want to pucke
0,If you are only coming to New Orleans for the French quarter then you are stuck with this place. If you don’t want to wait in a huge line then go to morning call
0,So overrated. It’s just dough man. Frozen mocha was good. I don’t get what all the fuss was about. THey were fresh and the service was lovely.
0,"Total tourist trap. If you must eat deep fried dough, the go. Otherwise, give it a miss. There are better ways to waste your calories than by standing in a huge line for unfriendly service."
0,"Maybe a NOLA Institution, but frantic tourists sitting at sticky tables eating overfried, crispy beignets that do not melt in your mouth are the best it has to offer. Go so you can say you went, but don't think these represent excellent beignets."
0,"Lots of folks seem to wait in line for a long time to get the flat doughnuts and coffee. Doughy bread with lots of powdered sugar. Tasty sure, but I’m missing the reason behind it. Try for yourself."
0,Cafe du monde a new orleans institution. The coffee was poor and the beniets where disappointing. Tasted like a over cooked doughnut. The cafe all though very original it had a gruby feel to it.
0,We waited in line only to realize there were separate lines for tables and takeout. Should have been better marked. Save yourself trouble and eat at district donuts instead.
0,"Lines too long, unfriendly workers. If not ready to pay immediately employees get impatient. Beignets fair at best."
0,"I don't know why people prise that cafe, they serve only regular coffee, French donuts and pralines. Coffee's not so great, donuts not tasty,not mentioning that they don't except cards, cash only."
0,Very slow poorly organized service. We waited over 20 minutes for our server to clear our table. Food was good service was as NOT. Took over 1 hour 30 to get coffee and beignets.
0,"Go if you must just to prove it to yourself, but once is enough. Better coffee can be had anywhere (I like French Truck), the beignets are fine but eat them piping hot or skip."
0,"You have to go of course to get a beignet, but the waitress was rude. All and all you have to go and enjoy the experience and eat a beignet with amazing powder suger"
0,"Maybe our expectations were higher with the fuss we hear about this place, but not a single one of our five family members thought the beignets were very good...and definitely not worth the wait!"
0,Poor service and not a fan of their coffee. The beignets were decent but nothing to brag about. A must see just so you can say you were there but nothing that would impress anyone.
0,"Not really sure why this place is a ‘must visit’? If you want bad coffee and a square fried doughnut then spend the time queuing up, if not try one of the many other better places than this in New Orleans!"
0,Not worth the long lines and wait time. Benguets were overfried and not a light fluffy French pastry. Go to the Morning Call at City Park for less crowds and outstanding benguets and coffee.
0,We went to Cafe Du Monde.....wont be doing that again. I can honestly say I had the worst coffee I have ever had in my life at Cafe Du Mode. We could not finish our coffees or the beugnets.
0,"I was on town for a race with my running partner. She heard so much about this place that we decided to stop by. We went at 9:30pm so the ""to-go"" line was not extremely long. The beignets were just ""alright"", nothing special."
0,I get that it's a somewhat historic site. But I can eat better beignets elsewhere. Their menu is very limited (just coffee and beignets) and the wait line is honestly not worth it.
0,"Too much people and a lot of noise and food residues over the tables. This place is not for me, but is good for other people that like coffee and pastries."
0,"Heavy dough, not cooked throughout We were looking forward to try the beignets, but we were very disappointed"
0,EVERYONE says you have to get a beignet from this place. Waited in line an hour. They were cheap...something like 3 for $2.75. And we got lattes. They were ok. Not sure it was worth an hour of my time
0,"My cafe au lait was cold and replaced twice, but finally hot. The beignets were just thick, fried dough with lots of powdered sugar. Nothing light about them anymore...."
0,The best part was the coffee other than that the beneights were hard and empty inside. The tables were filthy
0,Greedy wait staffs wouldn’t give you change claiming they don’t have singles when they have wad of cash in their hands. It wasn’t like the time I went many years back. I would not go back.
0,Done see what all the fuss is about. The coffee mostly but can’t complain too much as it was only cheap.
0,Usually always pretty crowded-indifferent servers as usual and as usual the best cafe au la and powder dusted beignets on the planet! A must if you are on the Big Easy.
0,Service not great. Food was alright. Kind of loud and they only take cash. Not a place I would really recommend.
0,Queues but wished we had not bothered as mediocre coffee and doughnuts. Cold outside covered seating did not help either!
0,Totally overrated. Ridiculous long lines. If you want a beignet go to Loretta’s in the French Market instead. They are also better there!
0,"Is not what we expected. We ordered beignets and they were lumpy and dense, instead of square, light and fluffy. Liked the beignets at ""Cafe Beignets"" 100% better than Cafe Du Monde"
0,If you don’t want to eat fattening fried sourdough stodgy lumps don’t bother going there despite its seeming popularity
0,"The coffee is average and the house special pastry, a “benny”, is reasonably tasty but not worth a 10 min queue."
0,"Yes, Cafe du Monde is an institution, but these beignets are greasy and dense. Try beignets but not here."
0,Cafe DuMonde was really disappointing. It was extremely disorganized. The tables were filthy and the food was thrown at us. It was a shame because we were looking forward to it.
0,You'd think a place like this would respect tradition and quality. No. Order Hot Chocolate you get Swiss Mix and hot water. Shameful.
0,If you’ve been to the seaside in England than you’ll know the donuts are lighter and tastier than the beignets which were tough. Coffee was not great either.
0,"The place is hard to get into, you're served overpriced food by wait staff who could care less. Go the the Beignet Cafe on Royal St. Way better."
0,I came away disappointed with the coffee. It was weak and did not taste anything like what I had years ago. Very much more crowded.
0,Too crowded. Beignets are very good. The rest of the food items are so-so. But this is the beignet capital of New Orleans.
0,Very very very disappointed!!! All this was was a lump of dough fried with powdered sugar on top of it. With a waiter who didn’t speak a lick of English. Come on you can do better than that for a NOLA institution....
0,"The place is fun (great people seeing) and a land mark. However, there are better options for beignets throughout the city. Prices are high and coffee is poor. Service feels very rushed."
0,Sat there unattended for some time (7:30 am). Asked a wait person for help and this landed in deaf ears. Other wait staff were seated inside the enclosed area and did not respond when asked for assistance. They only accept cash.
0,"Not impressed at all. I was so excited to go here. They were very heavy, more like a zepolli. Not worth the hype."
0,This bar is based on a few specialities; bignè and a little caffetteria. I expected a sophisticated bakery place with more French desserts. Sometimes big places are not so special.
0,"Had to try the “beignets”. It’s just a donut type pastry with an overload of powdered sugar, served warm. It was good especially with cup of coffe Staff appeared unhappy, no smiles Tables sticky from the powdered sugar , cash only"
0,"Told a must place to go. Staff was beyond rude. Once seated, waiter quickly appeared took our order and returned quickly. Coffee was ok beignets were good"
0,The fried dough is gross and the customers are rude. What on earth is the attraction??? All they serve is beignets and drinks. I was under the impression this was an actual food-serving cafe.
0,"What's all the fuss about? Industrial place, industrial customer service, and bad coffee. Not worth it. Go to some other better coffee places in N.O."
0,"We were told to go by several different friends. It's very touristy. The coffee isn't great, but the beignets were ok. Over priced if you ask me. I'm sure you can have beignets somewhere else if you want them."
0,The so called have to go to place. The sugary beignets were ok but the area smelt like garbage and service was poor. Teddys in Roosevelt hotel was much better for beignets
0,This was our 7th visit to Cafe Du Monde but we were not pleased this year. It took over an hour to be waited on after we were seated and they no longer use real cups for the coffee. We'll try someplace new next year.
0,Resturant was filthy !! Food was terrible and not what I expected Had better French pastry at Mannings. Don't waits your time.😢
0,This great tradition has been taken over by Chinese businessmen and RUINED !!! I can only describe it as McDonuts.... sloppy poor fast food type service... no atmosphere..... and a tourist trap !!!!
0,"It's reputation, as a tourist spot, far supersedes the restaurant experience. Too commercial and totally lacks the ambiance of New Orleans."
0,The cafe is dirty. The service is poor. The beignets are fatty fried blobs of dough drenched in icing sugar. Having visited France many many times there is no way that the French would eat these.
0,Worth the stop but get yours to go and go by the river for delightful scenery vs crowded dirtycafe. The iced coffee was great on a hot afternoon and the beignet was warm and fresh.
0,"The beignets are so over rated throughout this city. This cafe only takes cash. Who carry only cash nowadays??? Had to borrow money from my mom to order hot, but hard beignets. They were not good."
0,Busy place. Seating waitress and waiters not service-minded at all. We were close to invisible to them. Acceptable cappuccino. I had expected more from this well-known café.
0,Horrible service. Can get the same food/drinks anywhere else. Dirty and hot. Do not recommend. Much better breakfast options nearby.
0,"Poor service, terrible coffee, limited menu. The beignets were great but that's the only thing going for it really."
0,We visited late at night so there was no line. Inside it smelt like vomit and the bathrooms were so disgusting I just held on until I got back to our hotel. Just some greasy pastries covered in icing sugar.
0,This is just a busy tourist trap that sells coffee and deep fried doughnuts buried in powdered sugar. Save your money and go somewhere else - anywhere else.
0,Really nasty & too much powered sugar. They over do it with the sugar. Not all its hyped up to be. Disappointed !
0,"This is a staple if you are visiting New Orleans. However, the line was really long and the staff was below average. You gotta go, but keep your expectations low."
0,"Line moved fast but servers were not very friendly. The beignets were heavy, doughy and a bit greasy. We had much better ones at Morning Call."
0,"We stopped in for our first beignets, which were very tasty, hot, reasonably priced! The girl who took our order must have had a very long day. She was unfriendly and gave me the impression we were bothering her. Probably will not return."
0,"this little goodies are good but not that great, you can do a lot of stuff and enjoy more amazing places in New Orleans! get the mix, make them at home!! they taste the same believe me!!"
0,I cannot put into words how bad the service was in this café. The waitress tried to take money out of my hand to tip herself! The beignets are nice but not exceptional. The visit was disappointing overall given the reputation.
0,Over rated .. There was no line but the food was so so and coffee was not that good either .. We paid a lot and I could have have gone some where else .. Wouldn't go back
0,"Everybody said I had to go here for the coffee and beignets. Quite honestly, the coffee was pretty bitter and the beignets were hard and not too tasty. My grandmother makes similar desserts and hers are far and away better. I wouldn't go here again"
0,"My friends and I might be the only people on the planet who weren't fond of the world famous beignets. On a positive note, they were served warm with more than enough powered sugar. The place was packed and dirty. Note that it's cash only."
0,Really $4.10 for a large coke. I am not impressed one bit. The best part is people watching. Too much hype.
0,"I heard this was a must while in NOLA but why the buzz?! Terrible service, not clean at all and the coffee and beignets were just ok."
0,"Fend for yourself type place, hot, hurried, staff o phone or catching up while you wait, right in front of you. Food is ok. Very disappointed."
0,"Going to Cafe Du Monde always has meant that I truly am in New Orleans again. But, I'll stick to my memories. Every visit now the place gets more crowded, more dirty, more noisy and less civil (both staff and patrons)."
0,Decent coffee... Lousy service... Great beighnets... Not impressed overall... Took ages to be looked after... Staff didnt seem to want to help... Really a let down
0,Service was blah. No smiles or welcome. Beignet was cold and hard. Not sure what the hype was all about.
0,"If you've never had beignets before, try them! It seems Disney and other beignets outlets are much better than the birthplace."
0,"Beignets are tasteful but...space is dirty, waiters sit on empty tables, coffee is awful, iced coffee is convience - definetely not a must. There arw definitely nicer spots where you can have beignets"
0,"Beignet's are ok, same goes for the coffee. Not worth waiting in line. Its best feature is the people watching but I can grab a coffee from a nearby cafe and sit in Jackson park for even cheaper."
0,"Our 1st breakfast in New Orleans : so impatient to discover the legendary ""Cafe du monde""! Classic place not well kept; waitresses not bringing any cosyness to the cafe."
0,"Not sure what the big deal is here....it's fried dough and the coffee is not good, but maybe that's just me, I didn't like the chicory added, but you might, had to do the tourist thing and try it."
0,Very dirty with seats and tables. Service was quick but waitress was hard to understand. Very rushed to pay before eating. Not clean.
0,"We just did a beignet taste test between Cafe Du Monde and New Orleans Famous Beignets. Cafe Du Monde's were chewy, greasy, and small compared to Famous Beignets'. Du Monde's might be more famous, but their beignets are over-rated."
0,"The only thing I can say is the beniets are excellent,the service is very slow and unless you like crowds get the take out and go sit by the river."
0,I have eaten here many times while visiting New Orleans. I thought the beignets were heavy and the oil taste was more prominent. Didn't enjoy the restaurant like I did years ago.
0,The food was great but it was dirty. The service took forever and it seem like everyone was in slow mode. They didn't clean the tables just dumped the stuff in the floor for all of us to walk on.
0,Donuts (they call them by s French name. Something like bee yays and were messy and just ok. Coffee was overrated. Awful. Buy coffee and donuts elsewhere.
0,Too busy to enjoy and not worthy to wait and to pay for that service and short menu. They dont have many things to drink and nothing else to it than the famous sweets.
0,It is ok to go once. Limited menu. Staff not very engaging. You will leave covered with powdered sugar. Ice coffee was good. May be better to get it to go.
0,"Packed, hot and beignets not worth it. I can understand why people want to do it but I didn't enjoy it. There are other places you can try them, including another cafe du monde outlet in the riverwalk complex which is quiet."
0,"If you are in New Orleans you have to go once.....not because it's dancy, or amazing......it's just New Orleans!"
0,Nothing special. And overrated. Our waiter didn't even give us back our proper change. Guess he can consider that his tip. We're from NJ & zepollis are very popular and there's absolutely no difference.
0,"The place wasn't bad. But it didn't live up to all the hype. It was overcrowded, overpriced, and in the end...it was okay coffee and what I would consider funnel cake-like ""doughnuts""."
0,Overcrowded and busy. I love the history of the cafe but not worth the hype. You should definitely visit but lower expectations. We took our beignet over to the park rather than sit in the very busy Cafe. Prices are good.
0,Head over to Cafe Beignet or one of the other fine spots for coffee and bakery items. The Java is insanely hot (and not very good).
0,"Not worth the lengthy lines or the inflated prices for what you're getting. Sure, it's a New Orleans tradition, but it's a hackneyed one that I wish I hadn't wasted the time on."
0,"Not worth the lengthy lines or the inflated prices for what you're getting. Sure, it's a New Orleans tradition, but it's a hackneyed one that I wish I hadn't wasted the time on."
0,"Filthy dirty restaurant with unhelpful staff who barely speak English. Why work hard and clean the place up when there's an endless stream of tourists to buy your beignets and coffee? Beignets are good, but didn't see what all the fuss is about."
0,"Awful rude service. The wait staff we dealt with were unfriendly, made mistakes on the bill and refused to rectify it. Will NOT go back. The beignets were better at Cafe Beignet."
0,Stale Beignets and bad coffee. Go to New Orleans Famous Beignets in Jax mall. One block away across from Jackson square Fresh and no lines
0,The service was very unfriendly and the coffee not better than anywhere else. Cafe Du Monde is quite in bad state. Not worth the money you spend there.
0,"Always busy, average service, iconic but has lost its touch. Go to Café Beignet or West Beignet AT THE AIRPORT believe it or not serve much better."
0,"Great beignets, not so good coffee, and lousy, unsmiling service from the wait staff. Okay, so now I can say I had beignets at cafe dm."
0,"Go if you must to say you've been, but not really worth standing in line for sub par doughy, not pillows French doughnuts."
0,"The beignet was good, but the service was really lacking. It is cash only, so be prepared. Our bill came hand written on a napkin, just the amount due, not itemized. Bathrooms are disgusting."
0,Beignets were lukewarm at best and so was the hot chocolate. I was expecting so much more. Don't waste your time. Cafe Beignets was much better...
0,"Oh, the times when one came to cafe du monde for food and atmosphere! Gone, gone. The place is crowded, without any ambiance, and the beignets are drowned in oil and sugar. So disappointing...."
0,"Worth experiencing once, not worth waiting in line to sit down. Coffee was decent, beignates average. Much better options available throughout the French Quarter."
0,"Long lineup infront of the Cafe. Overworked waitresses. You feel sorry when you see how tired they are. Beignets far bellow the average, topped with unreasonably big amount of sugar. Must be the owners of the place are in sugar business too."
0,"Its a legendary location, and many peoples MUST HIT on their list. Yes the Beignets are good, but the wait and service make it a poor decision. Cafe Beignet is around the corner and a much nicer place."
0,Our service was the worst I have ever. We come here 3-4 year and it was horrid. There were plenty of servers and plenty of empty tables. Sad very sad
0,"Go to check the box. Get the 3-beignets bag and the mediocre coffee, eat one and save the calories and the stomach space for the other, more delicious NOLA food offerings."
0,Beignets were tasty. The line moved quickly. Atmosphere made us queasy. They herd you in and seat you. We sat near where the servers get the food and it did not seen very clean. I'd recommend the 'to go' line.
0,"OK beignets, nothing special really, just plain beignets. I do not understand why this place gets high ratings."
0,Loved it had a great experience love the outside patio.. the Beignets were great event a lot of great people and the staff was so lovely they were pleasant and they catered to our needs the wait time was minimal and the food was hot
0,"Of course the beignets were good, but no way is this relaxing ! We waited for a table only to wait more and then rush through the good part."
0,My husband and I visited New Orleans for the first time and everyone insisted we visit the well known cafe. We both didn't get what all the fuss is about and like funnel cakes from the state fair better!
0,Do it once. Move along and try the french doughnut at any number of locations throughout the French Quarter without the line.
0,"to many people, to many tables, not enough clean, not elegant. for me, not smthing that I can reccoment. I will just said to everybody, that place is very famouse and popular , but should be little renovated. also should be clean."
0,"Yes, it's famous... and because of that you can easily wait a half hour to get in to purchase overpriced coffee and a powdered sugar doughnut. I would spend my time and money elsewhere."
0,"I'm sure everyone has to go for the pastries but, the 'kids' waiting tables were too interested in their phones to take orders. Took 15 to get waited on, additional 20 mins for check."
0,Don't know what the hype is about. This place was very disappointing. Nothing on the menu except Beignets and average coffee. Service was terrible and the place needs a good clean. Definitely not a breakfast place.
0,"The service was great and the beignets were okay and appropriately priced. I don't think it's worth the wait though. Maybe my palate is not great, but it pretty much tasted like a carnival elephant ear."
0,"Definitely they have a great branding that makes this place so popular, however it is not worth it the price you have to pay for a cup of coffee (it is absurd). On the other hand their beignets are like rotten doughnuts full of sugar."
0,"Tried this place, but way too long lines for such mediocre biengets. Much better choices in and around the Quarter. They are ok, but for a true taste if New Orleans, I would suggest a place on Royal."
0,"Beignets were good. The coffee was horrid. Honestly, I'd have skipped it if it weren't for all these ""amazing"" reviews on Trip Advisor."
0,Stick to getting your B's elsewhere. The lady behind the take out counter was so rude. The coffee is not that good I was dissappointed after hearing about all the hype.
0,"Relying on past reputation - under new management and you can tell. Food and service nowhere near as good as before, Tables dirty. I am now going to look for the original people who have apparently opened a new place. Recommend you avoid."
0,"Staff are very uninterested, coffee was very bad, then got charged $3 for a hot water so I could have tea. Beignets are ok, nothing special....."
0,Horrible service. Slow. They ignored us for 20 minutes. How hard us it to clear tables and circle around and ask if you would like the ONE thing that is on the menu???? Food was good. Service needs some serious work.
0,Seriously the coffee here was so hot it scorched my tongue and roof of my mouth. Not to mention it was terrible. America this is not how you make coffee. The pastry may have been ok if my mouth wasn't so burnt.
0,This has gotten to be such a tourist trap. The cost of the beignets and the number of people cramed into the eating area made it too unbearable. Bring cash.
0,"The chicory coffee is good and part of the NO experience, however the beignets are tasteless fried dough with powdered sugar on top."
0,"No big deal for the 45 minute wait. But had to try! Wish I had tried other beneigt to compare. Glad we waited, at least to say we tried them."
0,"Atmosphere was nice, service OK, the Beignet we're so-so. I think it had it days in years past the bathroom was filthy. This rate as a typical tourist trap. I'm sure the locals stay clear."
0,Extremly crowded and full of dirty like papercups napkins and paperplates everywhere. People acting very nasty. Not charming at all. The waiting line is about half a mile. But the bignets are very tasty. But i am not go there again anyway...
0,After an interesting Cafe Au Lai and Beignets tasting in Starbucks type cup and the worst possible service I only thank that we didn't do an hour long line because it was 7.15 AM....
0,"Restaurant did not live up to all the hype we have heard about it. Beignets were nothing special, coffee was soso, and the restaurant was dirty even by outdoor restaurant standards. we will not be back."
0,"When I communicated to our waitress our beignets were heavy, doughy and tasted uncooked in the middle she giggled and said ""sometimes that happens"" but she didn't offer to make it right. The milky coffee was good, but we won't go back."
0,"The line moves quick. Friends insisted we try..... However, going to Casa Bonita in Denver for sopa pillas is much the same"
0,"I wasn't too impressed with this place. It just seems like a place for tourists to get beignets, which is a Cajun spin on Zeppoli."
0,Lines are incredibly long to buy a glorified zeppoli/fried donut ball and (admittedly) good coffee. Not worth waiting an hour for this stuff!
0,"Café Du Monde is crowded, dirty, overpriced, and more powdered sugar than beignet. Go to the Morning Call in Metairie if you want the real NO experience. Not this tourist trap."
0,Couldn't understand our waiter which made it difficult to communicate our order. The beignets are okay but basically fried dough. They offer coffee and like a couple other drinks. do yourself a favor and go to the many other restaurants in NOLA
0,"The beignets were ok but the coffee was terrible. I don't understanding what the hype is all about regarding this place. It's extremely crowded so it's a good place for people watching but other than that, I wouldn't go back to this place."
0,I'm not sure what the rave reviews were for other than nostalgia. I've had funnel cakes at the SC State Fair that were better than their beignets. It was overcrowded too. NOT WORTH THE CALORIES OR THE WAIT. 👎🏽.
0,"Told a must when in town.Long queues,no tea,only sell one thing,deep fried pastry drowned in icing sugar.place mess with sugar all over place,seriously underwhelmed"
0,"Rater have a praline or a funnel cake. Line was way to long!!! Not impressed at all!!!!!! Prices were to expensive. Went so we could check it off our list of thins to do. Been there, done that, moving on!"
0,"beignets and cafe au lait quite good,open 24 hrs 7 days and most of the help looks as if they have been working 24/7 if they need a break they sit on row of chairs along inner wall looking weary and sad"
0,It's good if you like tons of powdered sugar and bitter coffee. Great atmosphere though with lots of good people watching.
0,"Yes the beignets are delicious, but who the hell wants chicory in their coffee. It taste burnt. It NOLA go someplace else and get it better."
0,"long lines; crowded little tables. and this just so I can have fried dough and a luke warm cup of coffee. can you spell ""TOURIST TRAP""? Ugh!"
0,"Are you serious about your coffee? Don't do this to yourselves... Not only was the service abysmal, the coffee tasted like tennis shoe water... nope nope nope! >:["
0,"Not the best place to eat, service was incredibly poor and the food average, poor facilities for the disabled"
0,I was here in the late 90s and it was a quaint cafe with good beignets. Now it is a tourist trap with a long wait and mediocre beignets.
0,Skip it...the beignets at Cafe Beignet are way better! And there's no line! The staff at Cafe DuMonde are rude and inattentive. Check out Cafe Beignet instead...you won't be disappointed.
0,"The"" place to go for beignets and cafe au lait. I prefer Cafe Beignet for food and the service. Cafe du Monde each year gets just a little bit worse. The tourist mecca has a bit of a zoo atmosphere nowadays."
0,Highly over-rated tourist trap. Disgruntled wait staff and beignets weren't that great. There are better places in New Orleans for beignets and coffee. More history than anything. Don't waste your time or money.
0,This café is open 24 hours/day. The restrooms are very unclean. they should close for 1 hour to clean the establishment.
0,"I had high hopes after hearing about the reputation of Cafe Du Mond, only to be quite disappointed. The coffee was undrinkable, the service was poor and the only redeeming feature were the beignets which weren't too bad. Would not recommend to anyone."
0,"We went there for lunch but soon found out they only had the sugared beigneits to offer so we went with that. Service was ok, nothing special. Lots of asian waiters."
0,I ordered beignets and hot chocolate. Neither were worth ordering again. Good news was it was cheap and there was no wait.
0,"Coffee and biennets are the only fare, the service is slow and rude. The prices are high. Maybe it's a historic landmark but we weren't impressed. Save your money and go somewhere else! The restrooms were through the kitchen and very dirty."
0,"Yes, the french doughnuts are great! But the coffee is American coffee (no espresso) - I couldn't drink the coffee. It's more for the experience you should go drink coffee elsewhere…"
0,Coffee is blah and beignet is merely a greasy zepole covered in alot more powdered sugar. No reason to go to this place other than curiosity. Do Not single it out for a specific trip.
0,I went there because of all the hype. It wasn't that great. The coffee and beignets were so-so. Go if you want to say you went there.
0,it was OK but not as good as I was expecting to be and maybe because the difference of tastes: I like espresso so the cafe late was to light and the beignettes we have them as gogosi that we eat hot and fluffier
0,"What an awful surprise to find that this institution has gone so downhill. The coffee was good but the servers were rude, indifferent and it smelled terrible."
0,You can get anything here so long as it's cafe au lait and beignets. No black coffee..! Waiters weren't very pleasant and still expected a tip. Don't bother queuing for the experience.
0,"I left my cup as it was unpalatable to drink. The Beignets were the ""saving grace"" and delicious. Probably worth the visit because of its fame."
0,Every guide book tells you to visit Cafe du Monde and have their Beignets - they are over-sugared doughnuts and tasteless. Situated on Jackson Square which again is nothing like the guide books tell you is a bland square with people sleeping rough
0,Too much hoopla for something not that good. Don't waste your time or money. I had funnel cake at country fairs which were better. Fried donut with powdered sugar dumped on top. Skip and go to a local spot which is probably better.
0,I have been here before and really had a good time. But this time it was just too crowded and we left after 20 min of no service. Even the take out line was 20 to 30 people deep.
0,"After all the reviews of this place saying they have the best Beignet's, their Beignet's suck in my opinion. Very chewy and dense."
0,"Ok coffee, terrible service, beignets not my thing (fried doughnuts covered in powered sugar). It's one of them places you visit but the street performers and music around the cafe makes me give it 2 stars"
0,Crazy-bad service. Only go here if you've never been before and you go at an early hour. Not worth standing in the long line for.
0,"Service terrible, disinterested. Restrooms filthy. Rest also dirty. Have no idea what the buzz is about. Won't return. Benoits ok."
0,"Always packed, you get rushed in and out by the wait staff. I honestly don't get it... Why do people love to line up for average coffee and fried sweetbread. There's plenty of other places that do it better or just as good."
0,"Service was very bad. Tried three tables until we could get a server. Dirty floor, tables and bathroom. Enjoyed the Beinets and drinks, but can get that anywhere. Going there on and off for 15 years, will pass next time."
0,"Came here as we heard it was a ""must do"". I thought it was dirty and rushed. Coffee was mediocre and the beignets were nothing special. I didn't think it was worthy of the hype."
0,I understand that this a classic place to go in New Orleans and I'm glad we did it once. But the service there was terrible and we spent over an hour waiting for beignets. I would not go back.
0,OK - maybe I just went there on the wrong day at the wrong time (Sunday morning???) but... my beignets were dry and overcooked... :( I love beignets but these were simply not good! I loved the chicory coffee though :).
0,Beignets were over done and drowning in powdered sugar. Coffee was 'meh'. I'll find another establishment for my beignet fix.
0,Was disappointed in the experience. Staff was rushed and stood there till you tipped them. Coffee not very good. Couldn't tell you what was on the menu cause our waitress pretty much told us what we were having.
0,"Dirty, lousy food and only a shell of its old self. We did the takeout, while half of the servers sat around chatting with each other and watching the world go by. This place has seen far better days."
0,I just don't get all the hype about this place. Beignets are simply a carnival/fair version of funnel cake. Coffee is average. Place is overcrowded with tourists and loud which takes away from a french-like ambience.
0,"This is all about being able to say you were there! The food is poor, the area is dirty and the service is dreadfully slow, except when they are picking up a tip. Not worth the wait."
0,"This place is supposed to be a must-see. The lines were ridiculous, waited 45 minutes to have someone take our order. Finally got in take out line and beignets were just okay. Go to Cafe Beignet - it was amazing!!"
0,"CdM is what it is….but if you're interested in a good pastry, don't bother with the crowds or the beignets….heaped high with sugar but quite low in terms of total taste. The coffee was nothing special, either."
0,Had Beignets and coffee twice. Overly greasy and undercooked. Could that be cornstarch in with the powdered sugar? Don't know but will not be going back to Café duMonde now that there are other places in the area for much better beignets.
0,Ordered two coffees and beignets and was told bill was 26.00 I had to literally argue with the waiter to get price correct. It was very busy however with about 100 people in line Not worth the wait
0,"It may once have been considered authentic, but it is now a crowded tourist trap. There 're plenty of other places to get better and more authentic food."
0,"We ate there last night after a dinner. Had the beignets and milk. Go once, take your photos and be done. Seeing all the scary people eating here will scare you about America's future."
0,"If you visit the bathroom that is located in kitchen you will probably not eat your beignet. Place is filthy. Yes, Beignets are good but really how hard is it to fry bread. I will not be wasting my time again. Much better places."
0,The hot chocolate was made with water and tasted like Swiss miss. The food was ok but nothing special. It was like fair food. If you used the bathroom it was right by the kitchen. Not a good idea
0,Coffee was good but the beignets were hard and tasted as thought they had been spitting around a while. The bathroom was incredibly filthy which is a real turn off in a place that serves food
0,We stopped by here when we were in nola because of all the great reviews. The beignets were amazing but the coffee was seriously the worst coffee in America. Worth a stop for the beignets though!
0,Not worth the wait. The coffee was good but the beignets were just OK. You can get just as good or better beignets elsewhere.
0,"This place definitely lives on its name, but the so famous beignets are nothing special, they are definitely not worth the long wait in line. We ate much better beignets in the morning cafè inside city park, for example."
0,You apparently have to try the beignets but they are greasy lumps of dough covered in icing sugar...it is a pity you have to order three and cannot just have one. Not my thing but cool retro place
0,"Dirty place! Bad service! No flair! Beignets OK! Terrible restroom area near the kitchen! You have to stay in a line in the kitchen area before entering The restrooms! Disappointing place, not to recommend!"
0,"Terrible coffee, dirty, pigeons every where not very friendly service. If you want nice beignets go to beignet cafe."
0,"It was ""good"" but not ""great"" ... the line was long, it was hot, the choices were limited and the service left A LOT to be desired."
0,"Donuts, coffee, hot chocolate were very good but you need to look past the spotty service and rude service, donuts have been better in prior trips"
0,"OK so it was full but everyone is crammed together and the noise is terrible . The words ""tourist trap "" springs to mind."
0,The cafe is a landmark in new Orleans however the food does not live up to the standards: beignets rather old and nothing special on the coffee. There are better places in New Orleans to have a good coffee and a pastry.
0,Leave this to the boring tourists. Instead try Cafe Beignet on Royal Street for beignets with better service and a more pleasant atmosphere.
0,"I come from France and I never had a beignet like that. It was far from the French refinement. The service was poor and crowded, the beignet were stifling (beignets of this size are normally stuffed with a little bit of jam)."
0,"Cafe du Monde was a disappointment. A crowded, overpriced tourist site. You can get better coffee and begniets elsewhere in New Orleans. Avoid the herd and the totally impersonal wait staff."
0,To me they were no different than a funnel cake. Not worth the drive to downtown NOLA sitting in traffic and dealing with the crowds and weird ppl.
0,"While the beignets are good, there are probably a hundred just as good and without a line, at 10:30 in the morning there was still a long line for a very crowded restaurant. Be adventurous, try a small quaint place, and enjoy."
0,The Beignets are good however the place is lacking atmosphere. I can immagine that it once was great. Nowadays it is nothing but a big cash machine.
0,I am so glad there was not a line when we went because they would not have been worth standing in line.
0,I remember going here before Katrina and it was great. Now it's a tourist trap. It was kind of dirty and was not run very well. Very disappointed. Have your beignets somewhere else!
0,"yes, i can put chicory in my cafe and oversell it. nothing special just overpriced and somewhat bored staff. not worth the visit."
0,"The service is extremely poor.Waitresses are poorly trained,even rude!The beignets are good but there are other places that serve the same quality if not better."
0,"We were seated at an unclean table, and once seated sat there for 30 minutes without one waiter or waitress to attend us. Very poor service. If you want beignets go somewhere else. Good beignets but terrible service and wait time"
0,"-Fried dough with powdered sugar. Nothing special. -Crowded -Dirty: sticky floors, sticky tables, garbage cans overflowing, smell of garbage in the air I tried it once to say I have been here but not rarin' to go back."
0,"Not my first trip here, and I have eaten better here. Staff was slow and tables were filthy! Coffee was ok, beignets were luke warm"
0,The beignets taste like grease and powder sugar and the wait is really long. There is nothing cool or interesting to see there and the bathroom is gross! Not sure what all the fuss is about? It was kinda a waste of time.
0,"I'm not sure what the hype is about. Ill take a zeppole over this any day. Long lines, so so service. Ill pass next time."
0,"Total disappointment. The beignets were not good. The place has way too many people, and the service is suffering. Not worth the time or money, though it is quite cheap."
0,"Lots of people told me I had to try Cafe Du Monde and I was excited to go but the lines were down the street, the food wasn't very good, and the service was only okay. I wouldn't go again."
0,"Waiting 15 mins in to go line and ordered 2 coffees and an order of beignets. Coffee weak, watery and tasteless. The beignets were cold and tasted of old frying oil. Perhaps an off day but it was terrible."
0,"Of course you will try the beignets, but its a wait. Jazz is good, service is poor. But it is a must"
0,Always a line at Cafe Du Monde. I'm not fond of the seating system. There were other places with better beignets.
0,"crowded, disorganized, loud, dirty --- beignets were fine. OK place to go if you are in the area & must."
0,"Was really looking forward to a much anticpated Cafe DuMonde experience. Service was mediocre, beignets were mediocre, but coffee was surprisingly good. I guess if you like a clump of bland, fried dough, drowned in powdered sugar, this is the place for you."
0,"If you want beignet, Cafe Beignet is better. Too much powder and not very good service. Feels very inauthentic."
0,This place is living on its past laurels. It is nothing but a tourist trap. The beignets were nothing more that fried dough with powdered sugar. The place was also not well kept.
0,"This place is a mad house and the beignets are nothing special if you've had good cream puffs, funnel cakes or even great donuts. Not worth waiting for a table. If you must try just order to go and sit in nearby park or bench."
0,I couldn't wait to sink my teeth into a beignet on my New Orleans trip and I was disappointed. It was very dense and chewy and tough. Won't try again at this location.
0,This place is surviving only on its history. If this place was new it would not be in business long. Poor service and everything about it is substandard. Try Community Coffee for a better experience.
0,Great donuts in a filthy dirty place. Floors caked with dirt and powdered sugar with lines out the door. Amazing
0,Over crowded. Dirty tables with slow wait time. Nasty ghetto bathroom with what could well be the original bathroom fixtures.
0,Completely overrated and overpriced. Service is confusing. Place was filthy. But the atmosphere was nice.
0,"I was expecting MORE!! It was very dirty, with slippery floors and very unclean waiting staff. The beignets were simply mini funnel cakes, I've heard that there are other places in smaller parts of Louisiana that are better! :("
0,The staff were disinterested in serving us. Table was wiped off with dirty cloth leaving a sticky film on table. Dirty - the whole place needs to be cleaned.
0,"Over-rated, typically dirty and usually crowded. Go to the other place on the other corner of the square and get your beignets and coffee there."
0,"If you like beignets or haven't yet, make the pilgrimage and expect a wait; this place does an incredible volume of business so don't expect quick service. Afterwards, my wife and I wondered what the deal is. Oh well. Wasn't horrible but wouldn't go back."
0,"Don't expect too much! It is crowdy, dirty, has a very bad service! Even though is a must! You will see the waitress sitting there, smoking, chatting, doing anything but serving!"
0,"CASH ONLY. Beignets were only so-so. Definitely not a ""must do."" Wait staff very grumpy. Was glad to leave."
0,"Over rated, tourist trap with a doughnut and tons of sugar, bad coffee. I think you find something more delicious down the road... keep going!"
0,"Staff slow, premises dirty, coffee not that great even if they get your order right. Wouldnt bother again."
0,"The coffee is less than average, the beignets are okay, but that's all. The place is dirty, service was terrible and unfriendly. There is one restroom which is next to the kitchen, which doesn't look very nice either. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."
0,No ambiente and couldnt understand waitress. The coffe was served with a paddle and loveless. Im very disappointed of this place. One or two toiletts for such a big restaurant?
0,There is better beignets in the French Quarter. The dining area was quite filthy and service was slow. You can find better down another side street without being grossed out.
0,I'm from Houston. We got 3 beignet restaurants here so I was expecting something either on par or even better. Was worse than I expected compared to the other restaurants in Houston.. Don't see what the big fuss is about.
0,Beignets are beignets. These are alright. Place is really dirty. Bathroom is very dirty. Had to stop around midnight so at least I could tell people I was there for the last time.
0,"I guess you have to go here to truly say you have visited New Orleans...however...the employees have no personality, the tables are dirty and the beignets are just ok...I am not sure what the fascination is......"
0,"Glad we waited in line to experience this historic landmark, but not impressed with service, cleanliness or flavor of beignets & cafe au lait."
0,"Restaurant was filthy, long lineup for what? Beignets were soso. Couldn't wait to leave."
0,an experience - and maybe worth saying you've been there - however - beignets are over cooked and tough. Had much better in the quarter and would not go back to cafe du monde for beignets
0,"Just not my cup of tea -- or chickory coffee. The famous beignets are little pieces of fried dough drowned in an avalanche of confectioner's sugar. Massively crowded, sticky tables and the only place in New Orleans where we did not have excellent service."
0,"We headed here first - really looking forward to a taste of New Orleans - the coffee was truly lousy and the beignets, while nice, weren't a wow. Maybe 2:00 a.m. is a better time to be there than 2:00 p.m."
0,"If you see a long line, don't bother. If you want good Beignet and coffee in quaint surroundings got to Cafe Beignet on Royal St. Much much better."
0,Way too crowded for just coffee and a cake doughnut with powdered sugar.
0,"The prices and food is good, however it is an over crowded atmosphere and the staff isn't the most friendly bunch. If you're looking for a cute coffee/beignet place I'm sure you could find something better."
0,So overrated. Taste just like a funnel cake from a fair. Not impressed at all.
0,We had six in our group and not one of us was impressed. Went to the window to save time and the lady was borderline rude. Had the beignets and they were overcooked and crunchy. Definitely not worth the trip!
0,"Not worth the time it took. There was something floating in my coffee, and the beniets could have been made better in our own kitchen. DO NOT go to the restroom here."
0,"We went because its supposed to be a tradition to go here, but I can't say the food or service was worth it. We were only impressed by the atmosphere of sitting on the patio and watching the rather interesting world go by."
0,It took a very long time for someone to serve us. The coffee and beignets weren't anything special. I wasn't really impressed with the atmosphere either.
0,"Stopped by to have a few French donuts, 25 minutes later ....still in line & there were only 3 people ahead of us when we arrived. Very noisey, workers are not friendly and seems as if customers are a bother."
0,"This place is undeservedly famous. The beignets are hot and greasy, but the place is dirty and jammed with tourists."
0,Wait is ridiculous. Service is slow but I actually think there is not enough staff. Coffee is over-roasted (french roast) and the beignets were over cooked. Had better beignets elsewhere.
0,"Well, the tourist has to do this I guess. Get it out of your system, and chalk it up as one more thing in life that has now been done. Then move on."
0,"Tourist Trap! Filthy tables! Coffee is good, beignet's are ok if you like dense and heavy fried dough. Go to Cafe Beignet on Royal Street for a more ""French corner"" Cafe feel and atmosphere, not to mention better food with more choices!"
0,"I have to say I was disappointed after hearing so many good things. Service was really bad, and the Beignets weren't anything spectacular to me."
0,"The servers work really hard here, tip them well. But overall, why go here? It's touristy, and really crowded. I think you should try some beignets and coffee and chicory while in town, so you can stop by. But this place is really overrated"
0,Just get a donut and put a ton of sugar on it. You'll get the same effect! Not special just a lot of hype.
0,They serve mediocre coffee and glorified dense funnel cakes is what it comes down to. The place is messy and I'm sure many health code violations are pretty obvious. Nothing special at all. Skip it.
0,"I had read all these great reviews about Cafe Du Monde. I was so disappointed. First, the place was messy and dirty. The beignets were heavy and the coffee was just OK...tasted like Folgers. Nothing special to this place."
0,"Although it is allowed to drink beer from the age of 16 throughout Germany, 17 year olds are kicked out here. Get ready for it"
0,"I was here 30 years ago and had s blast. Tonight I brought my adult son. No one waited on us. We had to seat ourselves, no problem, but no servers even came by, let alone wait on us. We stayed 30 minutes then left."
0,Were waiting in line and searching a table so that at the end we were told there is no food left... feels a bit like a joke. Left without consumption because this is not how you treat customer
0,"Crowded, loud, and sub par service and food. Waiters would just walk past tables that were waving at them and deny taking their order. If you have kids be prepared for loud drunk people, no room for a stroller/pram, and no changing facilities."
0,"Very nice place, service is awful. Waiters are unfriendly and throw beer everywhere, even on jackets (Mr. Palumbo was very rude with us). You can't even pay by card. Surely I won't come back anymore."
0,Service was absolutely terrible. Was made to wait more than an hour for food and then the waiter shouted at us. Utter disgrace. Stay away. Not worth it.
0,"Attitude of the staff is atrocious and rude. After waiting 15 min and asked for the waiter, He told us that he determines when we would get beer and if we dont like it we can go. We left ofc"
0,Waited for service and when asked to be served the water told us he decides when we get serve. Than he tried to kick us out since we asked to be served.
0,"No one attended us- when someone finally arrived they moved us around from one table to another and when we wanted to order told us we can t have any food and when we said just beers, they said that we can’t order that either."
0,The classic german service in restaurant: TERRIBLE. My suggestion: go to another place. The waiters/waitress are rude. They think they can be rude because they are busy.
0,"Waiter insisted we ordered only one type of drink, and waa aggresive. Threw menus at us. Almost insisted on tipping despite the poor service. Great disappointment"
0,I’ve had better Schweinshaxe in Hamburg. Just buy the beer. Don’t eat anything. Waste of money. Buy a beer don’t eat food.
0,It wasn’t very busy as we could get a seat without any problems. Waited 10 mins for table service and nobody appeared. The live music was good until we left to find a beer elsewhere
0,"Don’t waste your time unless you love moody waiters, waiting 20 minutes to give an order, super salty food and thousands of tourists continually walking through taking pictures. This place has gone downhill so much from my previous visits I won’t be going again."
0,"Terrible service, never again. Rude staff who suddely decide after they tell you that the table is free come back and say it is reserved after you bhabe waited"
0,"Part of history, lovely building so have a look but it’s very touristy and you will get better beer and service elsewhere"
0,Very unfriendly to asian customers. Refused to take our orders despite asking politely for a few times. Food is ok. Nothing special.
0,Seriously think twice before spending your money here. If what you like is to be ignored for 30 min by the waiters before walking out thirsty then this is the place for you.
0,"Horrible place, awful beer, waiter unfriendly. Won't be going back. Too expensive to boot. Go to an Augustiner instead!"
0,Really really bad service. Not the greatest food. You don’t expect this kind of disorganization from the worl oldest tavern. Don’t go!
0,"Went during Oktoberfest 2018 from India and loved its ambience and vibrant air. Good service. A ""must-see"" place."
0,"Waited for half an hour, asked a surly waiter if we could get a beer and were advised that his non - existent colleague would serve us. He never did. Would not recommend visiting. Beer looked ok. Food looked average."
0,"Check your bill before payment!!! They charged us one more dish which cost 12.90 euros. We didn't check the bill and paid. Food taste terrible, the worst German food restaurant in the whole Germany! Eat at your own risk!!! 这间餐馆会偷偷的在你的收据里多加一道菜钱，如果你没有检查菜单，就会被多收钱。他们专门向游客下手! 食物很难吃，名气大而已!"
0,"What a disappointment, staff very rude. I was so chocked of the staff behavior, treating us rudely and unprofessional. very commercial, people taking photos like there is no tomorrow. not worth a visit"
0,"Horrible waiters and disgusting beer with chicken smell. I would not recommend going, its overrated and not worth it."
0,"Beer and atmosphere is great but the food is awful. Had Sauerbraten that I couldn’t cut through with a steak knife. The bread dumplings were like super balls. Don’t eat here, just have a drink and a pretzel."
0,"Tourist trap. Stay away. We were pushed in with a crowd of Chinese tourists and pushed out with a different crowd of tourists. It was so packed we could not really appreciate all the amazing and interesting ceiling artwork, nor enjoy a drink..."
0,go there to have a beer then leave. it's not a great dining experience. the restaurant has no a/c. waiters are RUDE.
0,"Amazingly disappointing! Terrible service, terrible food, over priced and watered down beer. Can’t believe they still pack people into this place. For a country that brags about its beer purity laws, hey better send an inspector to investigate what they are serving."
0,"Go once for the experience but then never go back. There are better beer gardens. You have to seat yourselves, flag down a waiter for all orders and your check when down. Terrible service and food but come for the ambience."
0,"Check your bill before payment!!! They charged us one more dish which cost 12.90 euros. We didn't check the bill and paid. Food taste terrible, the worst German food restaurant in the whole Germany! Eat at your own risk!!! 这间餐馆会偷偷的在你的收据里多加一道菜钱，如果你没有检查菜单，就会被多收钱。他们专门向游客下手! 食物很难吃，名气大而已!"
0,"not very Bavarian. Too many tourists. I didn't have a drink there. It's just not, what I expected. Feels like a trainstation tbh."
0,Atrocious service. Sat at a table for 25 minutes. Not a single server came to the table or even near it. you can get HB beer all over town dont waste your time here.
0,"Was told to find a seat anywhere & after 15-20 mins. of waiting, I finally asked if we were going to be waited on & was told ""No"" very rudely. My party got up & left."
0,Ignored by waitstaff for a long time. Food marginal at best. Waitress helped herself to a 10% tip. I would. Not recommend this place
0,No concept of customer service whatsoever. Waiters behave like they are superior to customers. Stay away.
0,Seems like customers are not important. Waiter said 'no' when we asked to order. Second waiter said 'maybe' when i asked if I could order. Overrated and terrible service. Food very average. Save your time and eat at restaurants that value customers.
0,"Fatty Pork, Bland cornmeal ball. Had to get up several times to get waiter's attention to get a beer. If you don't believe me, read the other reviews."
0,"Food is bad, and most of the waiters are not helpful, I have been calling for four or five times only to check the bill, not recommended for tourists."

0,"Hi, After waiting for 30 minutes, we were very badly attended. Unfriendly attendants, anyone there knew who would attend our table. Do not recommend!"
0,"I have been in the restaurant on the working evening with clients. The waiter was extremely rude. We waited for our dishes for 1,5. After he was staying and waiting for the tip. Wouldn’t recommend it to anyone."
0,Made to wait 25 minutes after asking for the bill. Asked for €5 discount. Got abuse from the barmaid in German. If it happens to you just walk out and left them with the whole bill until the service improves here
0,A major gathering of tourist and nothing more. Packed in a overcrowed hall you wished you hadn’t orderd. Go to other brauhauses to get the real experience .
0,Sat down. Waited. Waited. Walked out thirsty. The waiters were definitely more interested in the large groups.
0,waiters are just walking around and agnore everyone. food are ok. expensive. the prices not worth. dislike
0,The service was awful and the quality of food wasn’t the one i thought. We waited 30 to order and 1 hour for our food
0,"Bad education unprecedented. Enter, watch and then go to drink a beer in another place. Some people should not work in contact with the public!"
0,"When you have to wait hours to get an order in, waiter refused to take orders multiple times. Terrible place to get food."
0,"Service slow but ok , don’t expect fast service or much conversation from the waiting staff, pretzel girl was lovely"
0,It took over an hour just to place an order! Quite mediocre. Augustine's is far superior - better and more local
0,"If you like to see (and meet) drunken Chinese tourists, that’s the place to be! For city visitors: Just have a look in and go out again. That’s not Munich."
0,Disappointed. Only tourists. No Germans or locals. So it feels like Disney land and fake. Better to visit local beer halls.
0,No food no service. Just a waste of time tourist trap. Waited 45 minutes and still no server after 30 minutes of stalking for a table. Don’t waste your money or time.
0,We got the WORST hospitality in there . The waiters will say no to you when you are going to order or ask if you need any assistance. Worthy to be there if u want to be treated as nonexistent ghost.
0,"The place is very nice and particular, life music and nice ambiance. The food is very expensive I paid 13 euro for a plate that have 3 hotdog with different color but the same taste!!! It taste exactly like the hotdog from the supermarket !!!"
0,The whole place smells so horrible. Like a night club the morning after the night before. Service is crap. Building isn’t impressive. Horrid tourist trap! Avoid
0,"Probably the worst beer /lager I have ever tasted at 13€ I felt violated 😨 Best avoid at all cost, plenty other friendly pubs around"
0,"They refused to serve us tap water. We were asking for three hours but they kept on ignoring us, waiter after waiter. The food was too salty and the portions were tiny, but why on earth could they not serve us water?"
0,"Total tourist rip off- could be good, but the service is appallingly bad. Their attitude is literally they don’t care. Avoid"
0,"We waited for over half an hour with absolutely no service. Every time waitress told ""in a minute"", but nothing happened. Total disapointment!"
0,"We visited on an early Saturday when there were hardly any customers and the waiter acted like we didn t exist. We waited for 30 min for service and nothing. Finally left and went to Augustiner across the street, where we received great service."
0,The waitress was really unfriendly and the food was not good. This place is very expensive. There are a lot of other bavarian restaurants that are far better.
0,"The atmosphere is fun but horribly understaffed. Waited for 20 minutes and could not get a server even once - looking around other tables had the same issue. Only beer food, no veggie options outside of a simple salad."
0,"... in serving us and getting our business. Quote, ""It's not me, its the other one who will take your order"". Well, we left after 10 minutes not beeing served at all."
0,I really liked their beers but stuff yelled at me while im trying to give an order. I dont recomend to go there at all.
0,"Maybe the most traditional place for eating and drinking in Munich. Indeed, the beer was great but services were miserable. Waters not really prepared for serving the tables anbd food very far from the expectation. A trap for turists."
0,"Worst service I ever had on a restaurant. Lights were out 15 minutes before closing! Never again :( Food is also not that good, and the prices a little bit too high"
0,Typical german loud noisy big place nog atmosphere impossible to sprak normal and still hear eachother. Famous but Just not for me. Crasy shop with overprized stuff.
0,The Disneyland of beer halls. If you want an artificial Munich experience this is it! So touristy it might as well be in Las Vegas
0,Great atmosphere but awful service! Waited 45 minutes for our drinks & nearly an hour for food & only 2 of us received our dinner! Waiter said it's not his problem so we paid & left. Will definitely NOT go back.
0,We tried to eat lunch there. We waited clise to 45 minutes to get the menus and left. Dirty place but fun to see I guess. Just dont go to eat.
0,"We came here 22:30, waited half an hour for a beer, did not get anything then told us they are closed. Very poor customer service ."
0,"A touristic restaurant like here cannot be so rude and unfriendly to their guests. We were here for enjoy Bavarian atmosphere, not for waiter's angry face and arrogant attitude."
0,We were excited to visit this beer hall after being told by many people it's a must. However what a disappointment. Beer was good food lousy service lousy. Save your time and visit a smaller beer garden
0,"Bern there cause lots of people are talking about it but I was disappointed Piod is very salty and not appetising at all Very big, crowded, noise Not enough places to seat Don't have menu in English Staff is not friendly"
0,"Not good. Service sucks, tables are dirty and in bad condition, you expect the music to be like in Oktoberfest but in fact is boring. They treat foreigners with disrespect. Mostly tourists walking around inside and taking pictures. Better find another brewery"
0,"Never go. The crew of the restaurant is terrible, I was asking for a table, the waiter said ""Good Lucky"" There is no good points."
0,Very overcrowded and touristy beer hall. Took forever to get a table and even longer to get a drink. The food is probably the worst we have had during our six months in Germany. There are other beer halls that do it better.
0,"Service very poor, waiter cleared our table by brushing all the food on the floor we wanted to eat, but only had a drink as we did not feel welcomed."
0,The waiter was rude and slow. He should consider changing jobs. Obviously was not happy with his job

0,Obviously a landmark but terrible service and very average food.. Quite a disappointment this time round..
0,"Horrible dirty place! Extremely big, so service takes a while. Not a place for foodies. It has a souvenir shop with overpriced tat."
0,"One of those tourist ""must do"" things in Munich. Their food is average, the beer is ok, their service is however exceptionally BAD (even by German standards)! The waiters are mostly downright rude!"
0,Don't go here if you don't understand the difference between tables with cloths and not. Tried to ask 4 staff all of which were dismissive What an awful place
0,Aproximately 5 waiters in a hall for 500 people. Guess what the service is. Arrogant waiters are just a bonus.
0,The place was full of people specially at weekends. Tourists are not really welcomed at this place. Trying to take pictures can be met by rude and aggressive reactions from a drunk persons.
0,"If you like to pay 15 euro for MICROVAVED sausages (the plate itself was hot) and if you enjoy waiting to be served for 30 minutes, this is the perfect place for you"
0,"The waiters were so arrogant, even insulting. No one wanted to to serve us at lunch, we asked 5 times to order. They even told us to leave... Worst service i experienced so far in all my travels !! This is a shame !"
0,Went to try dinner at a famous Munich site. It is spectacular and huge but so noisy that your ears felt like they were about to bleed. I decided to eat somewhere else...
0,The atmosphere and entertainment is great but skip the food. We both got sick from it and it's really not good. Better off to walk through the restaurant and listen to the band from outside.
0,Our waiter today insisted on a tip. Most annoying. We also had to pay tax. Have a beer pay cash and leave.
0,Terrible food. Tourist trap. Awful music / entertainment. Stay away. There's better places in Munich. Not worth it.
0,"Over priced, so-so food. Way too crowded, a typical tourist place, with poor service. Skip it, and go to Andechs, you'll be glad you did."
0,"I've visited here 4 times because food and service are all good but today if was it was my first time to come here i would not come back, service terrible and waiter tried to short change us by €5 twice!!!! Be careful."
0,"What a boring tourist place. Staff too busy, needed to ask our waiter at least 5 times to bring our bill. Food menu weak. Bear good."
0,We have been here for couple of times and no interest to do it again. Food and atmosphere remained unchanged and no longer impressed.
0,"Too many crowds, bad & rude staff. Totally not worth the visit. Just click your picture from the outside. Their beer is avbl all over Munich, so you can try at any other place also."
0,Worse food ever. The service is super rude and slow. Dont go here if you want to eat good food. It was a really bad experience for me
0,Very crowded and difficult to find a table. Impossible to find a waiter to take our order. All menus in German despite this being a huge tourist attraction.
0,"Good for low demanding customers....trivial and cheap, food quality competing with fast food... A production farm serving pig, potato and low quality beer"
0,"This place is a must to visit. The atmosphere is one in a million, the staff, beer and food was amazing. A chance to meet people."
0,"Waiting sausage one hour, the beer looks like water. Very disappointed place. The tourist place, I recommend to find another restaurant."
0,"We walked in, and walked out within 3 minutes. Hot, stuffy, loud. I know it's an institution, but we wanted to get out quickly...especially after we saw a fight between two drunk men about to erupt."
0,"Really bad waiters, no one gave attention, really bad experience. Just come here if have to much money to buy the place and be respect"
0,Never have I rated anything 1 before. Visited on a Friday afternoon. Took nearly 30 minutes to get served. Wait staff rude and not interested. Had one drink and left. Zero enjoyment.
0,"This noisy, expensive, un-cosy place is highly over-rated as an attraction in Munich. Most smaller bier-gardens serve better food and have a more responsive service"
0,"Only tourists visit this place. I live in Munich since my birth. Maybe three times I was at Hofbräuhaus, food was always bad and expensive."
0,we just had a 2 beers it would be 12.20euro. but my credit card was charged 36euro. haha what a joke. Don't trust them and check your receipt before you leave.
0,"Loved the Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh much better! The beer was actually served in a warm mug -ugh. The waiters had no welcoming attitude. We went there 3 times, just hoping the next time would be better. I've save my Hofbrauhaus fix for Pittsburgh"
0,"Landed late in Munich and arrived at Höfbrauhaus one hour before closing time. The waiters and staff were extremely rude, and didn't want to serve us! The ambiance was loud and fun, but it was very disappointing..never again."
0,"When I got the table with my wife, We eaiting 20 minutes for meni. I tried to order with waiter, but he didn't want to get my order, so rude, stupi"
0,"Crowded and full of tourists, you have to go there at least once. The band is fun and the atmosphere is lively, but the beer and food are nothing to write home about."
0,"This was a touristy must-see! The building, ooompapah band, walls & ceiling, food and beer were as unabashedly memorable as advertised! We stayed for an hour+, but could have spent the evening there, if desired!"
0,"Many people passed and looked at us, once moved our stroller but no one served us. Not sure why. We eventually left."
0,"We waited around at a table on a Thursday afternoon around 3:00, not what you expect to be a busy time. Not one wait staff approached our table to ask if we would like a drink! So we watched the oom pah band and left!"
0,"Food - normal, can't say it's tasty, not cheap though. Beer - ok. Ambience - very noisy and crowded, you've to shout instead of talking to your friends. Staff - rude and service is poor. Overall speaking, I don't think it's worth spending money here!"
0,The service is really bad. Waiters don't even stop when you call them to order something. It took us nearly one hour to get a beer
0,"What a tourist trap --- get a beer but NOTHING else, we waited about 60 minutes for a lukewarm soup and some Weisswurst --- had to wait another 15 minutes to get the privilege to pay - AVOID IF POSSIBLE"
0,Only those who appreciate traditional bavarian Live Music and dancing may enjoy staying here. Two Liters of the Beer caused a horrible Hang-over and not only for me. The Food is less than average.
0,"Rude bunch of people.... Crap service and a complete waist of time. Go somewhere local, people are so much more welcoming."
0,"Big place, you have to find a table by your own. Smelly place, with awful music. Realy don't like it."
